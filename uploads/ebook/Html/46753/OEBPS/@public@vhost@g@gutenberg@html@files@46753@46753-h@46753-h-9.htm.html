<p>One classes Hokusai as a landscape-artist; yet his work was by no means confined to landscape. He pictured, as M. Théodore Duret wrote, "everything to be seen by the eye or invented by the brain of a Japanese." His "Mangwa," that vast twelve-volume<a id="Page_360" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{360}"></a> collection of drawings, includes sketches of a whole world of varied scenes and objects and people. The bulk of his production was colossal—dozens of designs a day throughout most of his eighty-nine years!</p>
<p>His figures are drawn with a swift and sure realism that is generally tinged with humour and often with vulgarity. His vigorous power of observing and recording faces and attitudes is almost unparalleled. Fantasy, whimsical conceits, irony, grotesqueness animate them; always they have superabundant life. The play of his brush is miraculous.</p>
<p>His landscapes are his greatest works. In the best of these he shakes off his trifling mood, and, as in <a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@46753@46753-h@46753-h-9.htm.html#Plate_51" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Plate 51</a>, creates designs whose stark brilliance and originality of composition is unsurpassed. And at least once, in the noblest of his prints—the rare and monumental series of "The Imagery of the Poets"—he achieves a high seriousness that will always be impressive.</p>

<p>Hokusai was born in 1760, the son of a mirror-maker. He lived to the age of eighty-nine years—a long life, crowded with privation that wins our sympathy, and with incessant devotion to his art. When in his seventies, he said: "Ever since the age of six years I have felt the impulse to draw the forms of objects. Up to the age of fifty years I made a great number of drawings; but I am dissatisfied with everything that I created prior to my seventieth year. At the age of seventy-three I, for the first time, began to grasp the true forms and nature of birds, fishes, and plants. It follows that at the age<a id="Page_363" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{363}"></a> of eighty I shall have made still greater progress; at ninety I shall be able to create all objects; at a hundred I shall certainly have attained to still higher, unimaginable power; and when I finally reach my one hundred and tenth year, every line, every dot will live with an intense life. I invite those who are going to live as long as I to convince themselves whether I shall keep my word. Written at the age of seventy-five years by me, formerly Hokusai, now called the Old Man Mad with Painting." His dying words were: "If the gods had given me only ten years more—only five years more—I could have become a really great painter!"</p>
<p>Hokusai's education began as an apprentice to a wood-engraver, a valuable experience for his later career. At the age of eighteen he entered the studio of Shunsho and adopted the name of Shunro. Under this name he produced actors in the orthodox Shunsho manner and melodramatic illustrations for the popular romances of the day. About 1786 a quarrel with Shunsho, due to the pupil's insubordination, led to Hokusai's expulsion, and he thereupon launched out for himself, to begin his long life of poverty and madly enthusiastic labour.</p>
<p>His work may be divided roughly into three periods. In the first he followed the traditions of Shunsho, Shunyei, Utamaro, and others of his contemporaries, with great skill but no special originality. His countless book-illustrations of this time were all conceived with lively fancy and vigour; but perhaps the finest works of this, his conventional period, are the very wide prints and surimono in which, against a<a id="Page_364" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{364}"></a> delicately suggested landscape, move extraordinarily graceful women's figures not unlike those of Utamaro. Already he was a master of drawing; but he kept incessantly at his studies under many teachers, learning, among other things, European perspective from Shiba Kokan. His work was done in this and the following periods under a dozen different names, of which Sori, Kako, Shunro, and Taito are the most important.</p>
<p>In 1812 began his second or realistic period, with the publication of the first book of his fifteen-volume series of drawings, the "Mangwa." In this epoch he turned from the styles of his predecessors and launched into a hitherto unknown journalistic realism. With a lively sense of the comic and the burlesque, and an insatiable interest in the homeliest details of life, he threw overboard all formal stylistic quality and set sail on a riotous voyage of naturalistic discovery.</p>
<p>The "Mangwa," which may serve as a type of his whole production in this realistic period, is praised sometimes as his greatest work. In it we shall find not only his most striking <i>tours-de-force</i> as a draughtsman but also the key to his weakness. All existence thrilled him as it did Walt Whitman; and each object on which he turned his eyes stirred him with the desire to record it in his pages. Day after day he worked like a madman, throwing off his sketches of man, beast, and phantom, of rock, river, and sea, in endless profusion and with inexhaustible ingenuity. And though we grant our admiration to the enthusiasm, sharp vision, and clever draughtsmanship of these sheets, we may still find in this undiscriminating<a id="Page_365" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{365}"></a> passion a quality incompatible with the highest reaches of artistic greatness. There is something vulgar, childish, under-developed in the mental attitude revealed; it seems a coarse greed for all experience, unlighted by the power to judge and reject, or by any consciousness of the ranks and hierarchies of beauty. It is a vast and dull enthusiasm; a celebration of the victory of the will to live over the will to perfect; a triumph of meaningless sensation over the just judgments of the discriminating mind. All shapes seem equally interesting and beautiful to it—all smells equally sweet. As Pater writes of Balzac—a man who was in many ways not unlike Hokusai—this artist "had an excess of curiosity—curiosity not duly tempered with the desire of beauty."</p>
<p>I can never look through the "Mangwa" without a sense of distressing chaos and a longing for the purer beauties which more finely organized artists have evoked from the heterogeneous welter of the seen world. But just this welter is at this time Hokusai's theme. "A debauch of sketches," Fenollosa calls it. In this work Hokusai stands beside Harunobu exactly as Whitman stands beside Keats—a more interesting mind but a far less perfect artist.</p>
<p>"Hokusai is incomparable," writes the commentator who furnished the introduction to one of his books. "While all his predecessors were more or less slaves to classical tradition and inherited rules, he alone emancipated his brush from all such fetters, and drew according to the dictates of his heart." True:<a id="Page_366" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{366}"></a> and this was his curse. No man has ever lived with heart profound and subtle enough for such emancipation. Nor have the supreme artists ever attempted it. In Hokusai's case this upstart-abandoning of all tradition was an error from which he was able later to retrieve himself; but so great was the impression produced by his vulgarities on the mob that even to this day popular Japanese art has remained under the cloud of it.</p>
<p>Hokusai himself did recover. In his third period, the stylistic one, the greatness that was in him transcended his petty interest in the trivial idiosyncrasies of seen things, and he created those visions which constitute his lasting glory. Between 1823 and 1830 he issued those series, "The Thirty-six Views of Fuji," "The Bridges," "The Waterfalls," "The Loocho Islands," and "The Imagery of the Poets," in which we hail him as master. No longer the dupe of realism, he brings us his dreams.</p>
<p>"The Thirty-six Views of Fuji" stands as one of his two greatest works. Here, in the forty-six plates that constitute the main series and the supplement, the same motive is treated recurrently, but with infinite variety. He depicts Fuji, the sacred mountain, in storm and calm, in mist and sunlight—sometimes dominating the colossally empty frame of the design, sometimes receding to a mere speck in the distance; and around the noble peak beat the waves of the sea and the foam of the clouds and the restless stream of human life, in a great epic of infinite diversity and profound unity.</p>

</div>
<p>In this series his trivial realism is forgotten, or<a id="Page_369" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{369}"></a> employed only in just subordination. Throwing aside his earlier vulgar absorption in the minutiæ of existence, he concentrated his vision on one conception, one chosen impression, so sharply and personally seen that he evoked a new style in landscape. Much it borrowed from tradition; but the flavour was Hokusai's. These designs are, primarily, magnificent studies in linear composition. The great sweep of Fuji's slope is related to the rhythm of every other line in the picture. And the line-dominance is preserved by the use of the simplest and most original of colour-schemes—green, blue, and brown—broadly laid on in large masses. A highly decorative quality and great boldness are the result.</p>
<p>The justly famous "Wave" belongs to this series. Here for the first time in our survey of the prints do we find elemental fury depicted with grandiose eloquence. In the majestic composition of the "Great Tree" (<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@46753@46753-h@46753-h-9.htm.html#Plate_50" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Plate 50</a>) the calm sublimity of nature and the infinitely minute, vermin-like aspect of man is superbly expressed. In the "Tama River" (<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@46753@46753-h@46753-h-9.htm.html#Plate_49" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Plate 49</a>) Hokusai gives us a sweep of wave and shore, mist and mountain, that his great predecessors, the landscape-painters of Sung days in China, might have envied. In all these prints he relates man and nature to each other with a vividness and dramatic power foreign to his great rival Hiroshige.</p>
<p>The world which Hokusai pictures in this series is not the real world, but Hokusai's highly personal translation of it into terms of superb imagination. A thousand memory-stored impressions combine to make the sharp composite of each design; and it is<a id="Page_370" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{370}"></a> to use the term in its technical Platonic sense, the Idea of the scene that he flashes before us. Herein lies the abnormal vitality that emanates from these pictures. "We feel," says Mr. Binyon, "that the world holds more wonders than we dreamed of, sources of power and exhilaration which Hokusai has revealed, and which we may go and discover for ourselves."</p>
<p>Hokusai's other great work was a series of ten upright prints of very large size, "The Imagery of the Poets." It returns in feeling, though not in technique, to the style of the classic masters; and remains, because of its high seriousness of mood and its sweeping magnificence of composition, at the very top of all Hokusai's work. Of all his thousands of designs, the one that is supreme is probably the print of this set which depicts the famous Chinese poet Li Peh beside the chasm and cascade of Luh.</p>
<p>Even his latest years were crowded with continued efforts. In 1849, at the age of eighty-nine years, he died.</p>
<p>Fine and well-preserved Hokusai prints are not common. His "Poets" and really brilliant impressions of his "Thirty-six Fuji" are very rare, particularly the former. Poor impressions of the latter are numerous. Practically all of Hokusai's most famous prints have been reproduced, and the collector must be on his guard against these worthless sheets. One of the best-known judges in Europe was recently deceived by a fraudulent set of the "Poets." Hokusai's fine bird-and-flower designs and his large early surimono are rare; as also are<a id="Page_373" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{373}"></a> good copies of his famous books, the "Mangwa" and the "One Hundred Views of Fuji." Numerous late blurred impressions of these are extant, and should be avoided. His other books are not uncommon.</p>

<p>Hokusai had many pupils; no one of them equalled the landscape work of the master, though several of them produced designs of great interest. As a body they were distinguished for their matchless work in the field of surimono.</p>
<p>The surimono was a type of print not sold in the market; it was made upon special order of private individuals for use as a festival-greeting, an invitation, a congratulatory memorial, or an announcement. Its size was generally small, about five or six inches square; printed on very soft thick paper, it displayed the utmost complexity of the technique of colour-printing. The number of blocks was lavishly multiplied; the most subtle gradations of colour were contrived; and the effect was heightened by every variety of gauffrage, gold, silver, and bronze powders, and mother-of-pearl dust. Yet in spite of all this effort, the surimono is, in the opinion of many collectors, not as a rule very important as a work of art. In the ordinary surimono the medium employed has outstripped the motive expressed, and what should have been the means has become the sole end. Nevertheless they are unrivalled as specimens of workmanship and printing, and the best of them are highly treasured. Some of Hokusai's pupils excelled their master in this form.<a id="Page_374" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{374}"></a></p>

<p><span class="smcap2">Gakutei</span>, who also signed himself Gogaku, produced perhaps the finest surimono of any that we know. His work in this field was voluminous and distinguished. He also issued a few exceedingly decorative landscapes.</p>
<p><span class="smcap2">Hokkei</span> stands beside Gakutei as a brilliant producer of surimono, closely in the manner of Hokusai. Some of his landscapes, printed in blue and green, have a curious charm and individuality.</p>
<p><span class="smcap2">Hokuju</span> produced landscapes in a strange semi-European style, with angular mountains and unusual cloud effects.</p>

<p><span class="smcap2">Yanagawa Shigenobu</span>, the son-in-law of Hokusai, copied his master closely; some of his work has great charm. According to some authorities he is the same person to whom Hokusai gave his discarded name, <span class="smcap2">Katsushika Taito</span>. Certain prints signed Taito are still somewhat in doubt, notably the well-known leaping fish and the moon-and-bridge scene, both from the "Harimaze Han"; Mr. Happer has brought forward evidence that these are by Taito, but many authorities still hold to the idea that they are the work of Hokusai under his early name<a id="Page_375" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{375}"></a>. Among the numberless Hokusai pupils may be named: <span class="smcap2">Hokuba, Hokuga, Niho, Shigeyama, Gokei, Shinsai, Isai, Hokuun, Hokuyei, Hokutei, Hokutai, Hokusui, Taigaku, Renshi, Juzan, Yasumichi, Bokusen, Keiju, Ryusai, Gangakusai, Keiri, Hokuyo</span>.</p>

<p>Hiroshige takes rank by unanimous consent as the foremost landscape artist produced by the Ukioye School. His prints, known to every one, have been more greatly admired in Western lands than the prints of any other artist except Hokusai. Hokusai's main concern was with the fundamental architecture of landscape; he outlined the structure of mountains, rocks, rivers, waves, and bridges with a hard and brilliant sharpness; but Hiroshige, less rigid in his treatment, seems chiefly intent upon the more delicate and transitory appearances of cloud and mist, rain and snow, sunrise and dusk, that give to a landscape at each moment so much of<a id="Page_380" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{380}"></a> its specific character. These atmospheric effects of his are justly famous. Few landscape painters of any race have succeeded in rendering so finely the mood of a scene.

<p>Hiroshige's great strength lay in his genius for strikingly effective composition, and in the skill with which he adapted his designs to the limitations of the colour-print technique. He reduced the pictured scene to a few simple elements of a highly decorative character, and managed to make them so symbolic and suggestive that we do not miss the multitude of details which he purposely omits. A strongly dominant unity of impression is the result. His finest designs convey a sense of personal feeling that even the Barbizon artists at their best do not surpass. With the limited resources of the wood block, he achieved subtle renderings of distance, aerial perspective, atmosphere, and light; and the poetic quality of his designs has endeared him to generations of print-lovers in a way more personal than is the case with any other artist. His work will stand beside the "Liber Studiorum" of Turner; it remains perhaps the most complete and magnificent landscape record that any land has ever had.</p>
<p>One curious characteristic of these prints at once strikes the Western eye—the use of a band of dark colour along the top of the picture, which is shaded gradually down into the clear white of the lower sky. This convention serves several purposes. It provides a mass to balance the colour at the bottom of the design, bringing the whole sheet into the picture and not leaving the upper portion as a mere margin above the landscape proper. It also creates depth and atmosphere, setting the brightest part of the design, the middle, back into the frame created by the upper and lower masses. And finally, it renders with<a id="Page_382" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{382}"></a> peculiar accuracy the effect of gradual vanishing which we actually experience as we look at a landscape: in our visual field, the sky does not end in a sharp line, but blurs and darkens at the upper edge of the space that our eyes survey.</p>
<p>Hiroshige's bird and flower designs are works of extraordinary freshness and loveliness; a unique and idyllic charm emanates from them, and as compositions they take high rank (<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@46753@46753-h@46753-h-9.htm.html#Plate_56" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Plate 56</a>).</p>

<p class="label c2">Plate 53.</p>
</div>
<p>Hiroshige was born in 1796, just as the great period of figure-designing was drawing to its close. As a youth he attempted to gain entrance to the studio of Toyokuni; but the fortunate fact that there was no room for him forced him to enter the studio of the less popular but more subtly gifted Toyohiro. Here he studied landscape, a branch in which he was destined far to outstrip his master. That delicate genius which was Toyohiro's cannot but have produced its effect upon the pupil; and it pleases one to fancy that it is some echo of Toyohiro's inarticulate<a id="Page_386" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{386}"></a> refinement of feeling that gains at last full expression in some of Hiroshige's most beautiful landscapes.</p>
<p>In 1828 Toyohiro died; and Hiroshige became independent. His earliest works probably antedate this time a little; they consist of a few figures of women and actors, and two very fine horizontal landscape series. These were the "Toto Meisho," or earliest series of Yedo views, distinguished by curious long red clouds in each plate; and the "Honcho Meisho," a group of views of the main island of Japan. Particularly the first of these sets contains work of great beauty.</p>
<p>Shortly after 1830 Hiroshige found occasion to travel from Yedo, the northern capital, to Kyoto, the southern capital, along the great post-road which he has immortalized—the Tokaido. There resulted his series of horizontal plates, "The Fifty-three Stations of the Tokaido," completed about 1834. This remains his best-known and unsurpassed work. <a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@46753@46753-h@46753-h-9.htm.html#Plate_53" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Plate 53</a> is from this series. Each picture records with unfailing vividness and originality some famous scene along the crowded national highway. For reasons unknown to us, Hiroshige prepared new designs for some of the plates after the original publication of the series; and these variation-plates are of great interest to collectors.</p>
<p>Of the many series that followed, only the most important can be named here. All are of horizontal shape unless otherwise designated.</p>
<p><i>Naniwa Meisho</i>, ten views of Osaka—chiefly crowded wharf and market scenes.</p>
<p><i>Kyoto Meisho</i>, ten views of Kyoto; a varied and delightful series containing many fine prints.<a id="Page_387" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{387}"></a></p>

<p><i>Omi Hakkei</i>, the Eight Famous Views of Lake Biwa; the most poetic and possibly the greatest of his works (<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@46753@46753-h@46753-h-9.htm.html#Plate_52" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Plate 52</a>).</p>
<p><i>Kanazawa Hakkei</i>, the Eight Famous Views of the Inlet of Kanazawa; distinguished by a fine simplicity of composition.</p>
<p><i>Yedo Kinko Hakkei</i>, the Eight Famous Views of Yedo; a series of masterpieces, of great rarity.</p>
<p><i>Chiushingura</i>, sixteen scenes from the story of the Forty-seven Ronin; fine dramatic compositions, with powerful blacks and greys predominating.</p>
<p><i>Toto Meisho</i> and <i>Yedo Meisho</i>, names under which more than fifty different series of Yedo views were issued by different publishers. These sets include many masterpieces.</p>
<p><i>Nihon Minato Tsukushi</i>, ten views of the Harbours of Japan.</p>

<p class="c2">Series of Fishes.</p>
<p><i>Kwa Cho</i>, upright panels of birds and flowers, some on full-sized sheets, others very narrow; uneven in quality, some being masterpieces (<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@46753@46753-h@46753-h-9.htm.html#Plate_56" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Plate 56</a>).</p>
<p><i>Fan Prints</i>, with landscapes or bird designs.</p>
<p>In the year 1842 began the so-called Prohibition Period of twelve years, when the sale of actor and courtesan prints was forbidden. The effect of this was to redouble the demand for landscape prints; and Hiroshige was called upon to supply it. This he did by issuing, among others, the following sets:<a id="Page_390" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{390}"></a>—</p>
<p><i>Tokaido Series</i>, published by Maruzei; next best to the "Great Tokaido Series" of 1834.</p>
<p><i>Tokaido Series</i>, published by Yesaki; slightly smaller than the "Great Series"; when well-printed, which is rare, they take a very high place.</p>
<p><i>Tokaido Series</i>, published by Sanoki, half-plate size; including many charming designs.</p>
<p><i>Kisokaido</i>, the Sixty-nine Stations of the Kisokaido Road between Yedo and Kyoto; a series in which Keisai Yeisen collaborated, producing twenty-three of the seventy plates. Many of the plates are uninteresting; but a quarter of them are superb. The set was reprinted at least twice in inferior editions.</p>
<p>In this, which we may call the Kisokaido Period of Hiroshige's work, he abandoned to a certain extent the delicate drawing of his Great Tokaido and Yedo Period and employed larger unbroken colour masses, aiming at broader effects.</p>
<p>In the fifties, Hiroshige abandoned almost entirely the horizontal or lateral prints of his earlier days and adopted the upright shape. In this form he produced the following series, as well as others not named:—</p>
<p><i>Upright Tokaido</i>, published by Tsutaya, 1855; a fine series when well printed, but the late editions were crude in colour (<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@46753@46753-h@46753-h-9.htm.html#Plate_54" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Plate 54</a>).</p>
<p><i>Views of the Sixty-nine Provinces</i>, 1856; the rare first edition, which is much the finer, is distinguished by having five seals on the face of each plate. It contains a great deal of uninteresting work, but also ten or fifteen masterpieces.<a id="Page_391" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{391}"></a></p>

<p><i>Three Triptychs.</i>—The Rapids of Awa No Naruto, Moonlight View of Kanazawa, and Snow Mountains on the Kiso Highway, all dated 1857, and all magnificent.</p>
<p><i>Two Kakemono-ye</i>, very large—the Monkey Bridge and the Snow Gorge of the Fuji River, things of matchless impressiveness.</p>
<p><i>The One Hundred Views of Yedo</i>, 1858; 119 plates, including, besides much rubbish, 25 masterpieces (<a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@46753@46753-h@46753-h-9.htm.html#Plate_55" class="pginternal" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Plate 55</a>).</p>
<p><i>The Thirty-six Views of Fuji</i>, 1859; inferior, upon the whole, to his earlier work. There are in existence very few well-printed copies.</p>
<p>In the last two or three of these series it is more than probable that Hiroshige was assisted by his pupil Hiroshige II. The finest plates in all these later series are equal to the master's most splendid earlier designs; but certain of the plates are of so banal a character that it is impossible to believe them to be from the great man's hand. Doubtless the distinction between the work of the two artists cannot always be drawn with certainty; but as a general rule we may regard the work as that of Hiroshige II if we find the figures stiff and wooden, if the composition is lacking in any central unity, or if some large ugly object is thrust into the foreground with the hope of thus putting the background into its proper relative place. At this period less care was taken with the printing, and the majority of prints from these later series are miserable impressions that libel Hiroshige's powers. When well printed they can be very fine indeed; but the<a id="Page_394" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{394}"></a> poor copies outnumber the good a hundred to one.</p>
<p>In the year 1858, just after the publication of the "One Hundred Views of Yedo," Hiroshige died. He did not live to see the plates for his "Thirty-six Views of Fuji" completed. One of the collector's treasures is a striking memorial portrait by Kunisada that was issued shortly after Hiroshige's death. The old man is represented with a finely shaped head, powerful, quiet features, and eyes as piercing as an eagle's.</p>
<p>The number of Hiroshige's different designs runs into at least three or four thousand, not counting his illustrated books; and there must be in existence a hundred thousand prints by him. His work is almost as plentiful as that of all the other artists taken together. In spite of this great abundance, the collector finds it difficult to-day to obtain many really fine prints by him. The prints usually offered are either in bad condition, or they are careless impressions produced without proper attention to the difficult problem of printing. The rush occasioned by Hiroshige's popularity naturally led to slighted work. Even in these poor copies a certain fascination of design generally appears; but it is only in the carefully printed copies, where the register is accurate and the colours are delicately graded, luminous, and soft, that the full beauty of Hiroshige's conception is made clear. Familiarity with the finer impressions forever spoils the attentive observer's taste for the crude ordinary copies. The task of the collector of Hiroshige's work to-day resolves itself<a id="Page_397" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{397}"></a> into a search for these rare and precious early prints. The collector should lose no opportunity to compare different copies of the same print; only thus can he educate his eyes sufficiently to appreciate the vast difference between fine and inferior examples. The difference, once grasped, is unforgettable.</p>

<p>The reader who desires detailed information as to the long list of Hiroshige's work is referred to the Sale Catalogue of the Collection of John Stewart Happer (Sotheby, Wilkinson, and Hodge, London), which is the present foundation for any real study of the subject. A valuable article on seal-dates by Major J. J. O'Brien Sexton, in the <i>International Studio</i> for May, 1913, should also be consulted by the student.</p>
<h3 id="pgepubid00065"><span class="smcap1">The Second Hiroshige.</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap2">Hiroshige II</span>, born 1826, was the adopted son of the great Hiroshige; as we have seen, he probably assisted in some of the master's last work. After Hiroshige's death the pupil assumed the master's name, previous to that he had been known as Ichiusai Shigenobu. He is not to be confused with Yanagawa Shigenobu, Hokusai's pupil.</p>
<p>It was once thought that Hiroshige II produced all the upright prints signed Hiroshige. Mr. Happer has once for all discredited this idea, and it is no longer held by any one.</p>
<p>Some of the work of Hiroshige II is very good; upon the accidental destruction of one of the plates of the "One Hundred Yedo Series," he produced a new design that is admirable. But he lacked originality,<a id="Page_398" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="{398}"></a> and at his best merely trod in the footsteps of his master. Most of his designs are flat and uninspired. About 1865 he fell into disgrace, and moved to Yokohama, where he gave up his name, and is said to have worked henceforth under the name of Hirochika II. He died in 1869.</p>
<p>There was also a Hiroshige III, who died in 1896—a wholly commonplace and unimportant artist, who assumed the great name about 1865.</p>
<h3 id="pgepubid00066"><span class="smcap1">Followers and Contemporaries of Hiroshige.</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap2">Keisai Yeisen</span>, who collaborated with Hiroshige in the "Kisokaido Series," was born in 1791 and died in 1851. He produced many figure-prints, following Yeizan, in the debased style of his contemporaries. His landscapes, however, are his most interesting work. Many of these follow Hiroshige tamely; but a few, in the older Kano manner, are surprising and splendid designs. One of these, a rare sheet depicting a bridge and mountains in moonlight, in <i>kakamono-ye</i> form, must be regarded as a masterpiece. His ordinary work is rather undistinguished.</p>
