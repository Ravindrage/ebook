Gloucester's Castle.</h2>

<p id="id00150">Enter Gloucester and Edmund.</p>

<p id="id00151">  Glou. Alack, alack, Edmund, I like not this unnatural dealing!<br/>

When<br/>

     I desir'd their leave that I might pity him, they took from<br/>

me<br/>

     the use of mine own house, charg'd me on pain of perpetual<br/>

     displeasure neither to speak of him, entreat for him, nor<br/>

any<br/>

     way sustain him.<br/>

  Edm. Most savage and unnatural!<br/>

  Glou. Go to; say you nothing. There is division betwixt the<br/>

Dukes,<br/>

     and a worse matter than that. I have received a letter this<br/>

     night- 'tis dangerous to be spoken- I have lock'd the letter<br/>

in<br/>

     my closet. These injuries the King now bears will be<br/>

revenged<br/>

     home; there's part of a power already footed; we must<br/>

incline to<br/>

     the King. I will seek him and privily relieve him. Go you<br/>

and<br/>

     maintain talk with the Duke, that my charity be not of him<br/>

     perceived. If he ask for me, I am ill and gone to bed.<br/>

Though I<br/>

     die for't, as no less is threat'ned me, the King my old<br/>

master<br/>

     must be relieved. There is some strange thing toward,<br/>

Edmund.<br/>

     Pray you be careful.                                  Exit.<br/>

  Edm. This courtesy, forbid thee, shall the Duke<br/>

     Instantly know, and of that letter too.<br/>

     This seems a fair deserving, and must draw me<br/>

     That which my father loses- no less than all.<br/>

     The younger rises when the old doth fall.             Exit.<br/>

<h2 id="id00152" style="margin-top: 4em">Scene IV.
The heath. Before a hovel.</h2>

<p id="id00153">Storm still. Enter Lear, Kent, and Fool.</p>

<p id="id00154">  Kent. Here is the place, my lord. Good my lord, enter.<br/>

     The tyranny of the open night 's too rough<br/>

     For nature to endure.<br/>

  Lear. Let me alone.<br/>

  Kent. Good my lord, enter here.<br/>

  Lear. Wilt break my heart?<br/>

  Kent. I had rather break mine own. Good my lord, enter.<br/>

  Lear. Thou think'st 'tis much that this contentious storm<br/>

     Invades us to the skin. So 'tis to thee;<br/>

     But where the greater malady is fix'd,<br/>

     The lesser is scarce felt. Thou'dst shun a bear;<br/>

     But if thy flight lay toward the raging sea,<br/>

     Thou'dst meet the bear i' th' mouth. When the mind's free,<br/>

     The body's delicate. The tempest in my mind<br/>

     Doth from my senses take all feeling else<br/>

     Save what beats there. Filial ingratitude!<br/>

     Is it not as this mouth should tear this hand<br/>

     For lifting food to't? But I will punish home!<br/>

     No, I will weep no more. In such a night<br/>

     To shut me out! Pour on; I will endure.<br/>

     In such a night as this! O Regan, Goneril!<br/>

     Your old kind father, whose frank heart gave all!<br/>

     O, that way madness lies; let me shun that!<br/>

     No more of that.<br/>

  Kent. Good my lord, enter here.<br/>

  Lear. Prithee go in thyself; seek thine own ease.<br/>

     This tempest will not give me leave to ponder<br/>

     On things would hurt me more. But I'll go in.<br/>

     [To the Fool] In, boy; go first.- You houseless poverty-<br/>

     Nay, get thee in. I'll pray, and then I'll sleep.<br/>

                                                    Exit [Fool].<br/>

     Poor naked wretches, wheresoe'er you are,<br/>

     That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm,<br/>

     How shall your houseless heads and unfed sides,<br/>

     Your loop'd and window'd raggedness, defend you<br/>

     From seasons such as these? O, I have ta'en<br/>

     Too little care of this! Take physic, pomp;<br/>

     Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,<br/>

     That thou mayst shake the superflux to them<br/>

     And show the heavens more just.<br/>

  Edg. [within] Fathom and half, fathom and half! Poor Tom!<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00155">                     Enter Fool [from the hovel].</p>

<p id="id00156">  Fool. Come not in here, nuncle, here's a spirit. Help me, help<br/>

me!<br/>

  Kent. Give me thy hand. Who's there?<br/>

  Fool. A spirit, a spirit! He says his name's poor Tom.<br/>

  Kent. What art thou that dost grumble there i' th' straw?<br/>

     Come forth.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00157">                 Enter Edgar [disguised as a madman].</p>

<p id="id00158" style="margin-right: 2%; margin-left: 2%">  Edg. Away! the foul fiend follows me! Through the sharp
hawthorn
     blows the cold wind. Humh! go to thy cold bed, and warm
thee.
  Lear. Hast thou given all to thy two daughters, and art thou
come
     to this?
  Edg. Who gives anything to poor Tom? whom the foul fiend hath
led
     through fire and through flame, through ford and whirlpool,
o'er
     bog and quagmire; that hath laid knives under his pillow and
     halters in his pew, set ratsbane by his porridge, made him
proud
     of heart, to ride on a bay trotting horse over four-inch'd
     bridges, to course his own shadow for a traitor. Bless thy
five
     wits! Tom 's acold. O, do de, do de, do de. Bless thee from
     whirlwinds, star-blasting, and taking! Do poor Tom some
charity,
     whom the foul fiend vexes. There could I have him now- and
there-
     and there again- and there!
                                                    Storm still.
  Lear. What, have his daughters brought him to this pass?
     Couldst thou save nothing? Didst thou give 'em all?
  Fool. Nay, he reserv'd a blanket, else we had been all sham'd.
  Lear. Now all the plagues that in the pendulous air
     Hang fated o'er men's faults light on thy daughters!
  Kent. He hath no daughters, sir.
  Lear. Death, traitor! nothing could have subdu'd nature
     To such a lowness but his unkind daughters.
     Is it the fashion that discarded fathers
     Should have thus little mercy on their flesh?
     Judicious punishment! 'Twas this flesh begot
     Those pelican daughters.
  Edg. Pillicock sat on Pillicock's Hill. 'Allow, 'allow, loo,
loo!
  Fool. This cold night will turn us all to fools and madmen.
  Edg. Take heed o' th' foul fiend; obey thy parents: keep thy
word
     justly; swear not; commit not with man's sworn spouse; set
not
     thy sweet heart on proud array. Tom 's acold.
  Lear. What hast thou been?
  Edg. A servingman, proud in heart and mind; that curl'd my
hair,
     wore gloves in my cap; serv'd the lust of my mistress' heart
and
     did the act of darkness with her; swore as many oaths as I
spake
     words, and broke them in the sweet face of heaven; one that
     slept in the contriving of lust, and wak'd to do it. Wine
lov'd
     I deeply, dice dearly; and in woman out-paramour'd the Turk.
     False of heart, light of ear, bloody of hand; hog in sloth,
fox
     in stealth, wolf in greediness, dog in madness, lion in
prey.
     Let not the creaking of shoes nor the rustling of silks
betray
     thy poor heart to woman. Keep thy foot out of brothel, thy
hand
     out of placket, thy pen from lender's book, and defy the
foul
     fiend. Still through the hawthorn blows the cold wind; says
     suum, mun, hey, no, nonny. Dolphin my boy, my boy, sessa!
let
     him trot by.
                                                    Storm still.
  Lear. Why, thou wert better in thy grave than to answer with
thy
     uncover'd body this extremity of the skies. Is man no more
than
     this? Consider him well. Thou ow'st the worm no silk, the
beast
     no hide, the sheep no wool, the cat no perfume. Ha! Here's
three
     on's are sophisticated! Thou art the thing itself;
     unaccommodated man is no more but such a poor, bare, forked
     animal as thou art. Off, off, you lendings! Come, unbutton
     here.
                                         [Tears at his clothes.]
  Fool. Prithee, nuncle, be contented! 'Tis a naughty night to
swim
     in. Now a little fire in a wild field were like an old
lecher's
     heart- a small spark, all the rest on's body cold. Look,
here
     comes a walking fire.</p>

<p id="id00159">                    Enter Gloucester with a torch.</p>

<p id="id00160">  Edg. This is the foul fiend Flibbertigibbet. He begins at<br/>

curfew,<br/>

     and walks till the first cock. He gives the web and the pin,<br/>

     squints the eye, and makes the harelip; mildews the white<br/>

  Lear. What's he?<br/>

  Kent. Who's there? What is't you seek?<br/>

  Glou. What are you there? Your names?<br/>

  Edg. Poor Tom, that eats the swimming frog, the toad, the<br/>

todpole,<br/>

     the wall-newt and the water; that in the fury of his heart,<br/>

when<br/>

     the foul fiend rages, eats cow-dung for sallets, swallows<br/>

the<br/>

     old rat and the ditch-dog, drinks the green mantle of the<br/>

     standing pool; who is whipp'd from tithing to tithing, and<br/>

     stock-punish'd and imprison'd; who hath had three suits to<br/>

his<br/>

     back, six shirts to his body, horse to ride, and weapons to<br/>

     wear;<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00163">          But mice and rats, and such small deer,<br/>

</p>

<p id="id00164">     Beware my follower. Peace, Smulkin! peace, thou fiend!<br/>

  Glou. What, hath your Grace no better company?<br/>

  Edg. The prince of darkness is a gentleman!<br/>

     Modo he's call'd, and Mahu.<br/>

  Glou. Our flesh and blood is grown so vile, my lord,<br/>

     That it doth hate what gets it.<br/>

  Edg. Poor Tom 's acold.<br/>

  Glou. Go in with me. My duty cannot suffer<br/>

     T' obey in all your daughters' hard commands.<br/>

     Though their injunction be to bar my doors<br/>

     And let this tyrannous night take hold upon you,<br/>

     Yet have I ventur'd to come seek you out<br/>

     And bring you where both fire and food is ready.<br/>

  Lear. First let me talk with this philosopher.<br/>

     What is the cause of thunder?<br/>

  Kent. Good my lord, take his offer; go into th' house.<br/>

  Lear. I'll talk a word with this same learned Theban.<br/>

     What is your study?<br/>

  Edg. How to prevent the fiend and to kill vermin.<br/>

  Lear. Let me ask you one word in private.<br/>

  Kent. Importune him once more to go, my lord.<br/>

     His wits begin t' unsettle.<br/>

  Glou. Canst thou blame him?<br/>

                                                    Storm still.<br/>

     His daughters seek his death. Ah, that good Kent!<br/>

     He said it would be thus- poor banish'd man!<br/>

     Thou say'st the King grows mad: I'll tell thee, friend,<br/>

     I am almost mad myself. I had a son,<br/>

     Now outlaw'd from my blood. He sought my life<br/>

     But lately, very late. I lov'd him, friend-<br/>

     No father his son dearer. True to tell thee,<br/>

     The grief hath craz'd my wits. What a night 's this!<br/>

     I do beseech your Grace-<br/>

  Lear. O, cry you mercy, sir.<br/>

     Noble philosopher, your company.<br/>

  Edg. Tom's acold.<br/>

  Glou. In, fellow, there, into th' hovel; keep thee warm.<br/>

  Lear. Come, let's in all.<br/>

  Kent. This way, my lord.<br/>

  Lear. With him!<br/>

     I will keep still with my philosopher.<br/>

  Kent. Good my lord, soothe him; let him take the fellow.<br/>

  Glou. Take him you on.<br/>

  Kent. Sirrah, come on; go along with us.<br/>

  Lear. Come, good Athenian.<br/>

  Glou. No words, no words! hush.<br/>

  Edg. Child Rowland to the dark tower came;<br/>

<p id="id00167">Enter Cornwall and Edmund.</p>

<p id="id00168">  Corn. I will have my revenge ere I depart his house.<br/>

  Edm. How, my lord, I may be censured, that nature thus gives<br/>

way to<br/>

     loyalty, something fears me to think of.<br/>

  Corn. I now perceive it was not altogether your brother's evil<br/>

     disposition made him seek his death; but a provoking merit,<br/>

set<br/>

     awork by a reproveable badness in himself.<br/>

  Edm. How malicious is my fortune that I must repent to be just!<br/>

     This is the letter he spoke of, which approves him an<br/>

     intelligent party to the advantages of France. O heavens!<br/>

that<br/>

     this treason were not- or not I the detector!<br/>

  Corn. Go with me to the Duchess.<br/>

  Edm. If the matter of this paper be certain, you have mighty<br/>

  Corn. True or false, it hath made thee Earl of Gloucester.<br/>

     Seek out where thy father is, that he may be ready for our<br/>

  Edm. [aside] If I find him comforting the King, it will stuff<br/>

his<br/>

loyalty,<br/>

                                              Exit [Gloucester].<br/>

  Edg. Frateretto calls me, and tells me Nero is an angler in the<br/>

  Fool. Prithee, nuncle, tell me whether a madman be a gentleman<br/>

or a<br/>

     yeoman.<br/>

  Lear. A king, a king!<br/>

  Fool. No, he's a yeoman that has a gentleman to his son; for<br/>

he's a<br/>

     mad yeoman that sees his son a gentleman before him.<br/>

  Lear. To have a thousand with red burning spits<br/>

     Come hizzing in upon 'em-<br/>

  Edg. The foul fiend bites my back.<br/>

  Fool. He's mad that trusts in the tameness of a wolf, a horse's<br/>

     hearts? [To Edgar] You, sir- I entertain you for one of my<br/>

     hundred; only I do not like the fashion of your garments.<br/>

You'll<br/>

     say they are Persian attire; but let them be chang'd.<br/>

  Kent. Now, good my lord, lie here and rest awhile.<br/>

  Lear. Make no noise, make no noise; draw the curtains.<br/>

     So, so, so. We'll go to supper i' th' morning. So, so, so.<br/>

     He childed as I fathered! Tom, away!<br/>

     Mark the high noises, and thyself bewray<br/>

     Some five or six and thirty of his knights,<br/>

     Hot questrists after him, met him at gate;<br/>

     Who, with some other of the lord's dependants,<br/>

     Are gone with him towards Dover, where they boast<br/>

     To have well-armed friends.<br/>

  Corn. Get horses for your mistress.<br/>

  Gon. Farewell, sweet lord, and sister.<br/>

  Corn. Edmund, farewell.<br/>

                           Exeunt Goneril, [Edmund, and Oswald].<br/>

     Go seek the traitor Gloucester,<br/>

     Pinion him like a thief, bring him before us.<br/>

                                        [Exeunt other Servants.]<br/>

     Though well we may not pass upon his life<br/>

     Without the form of justice, yet our power<br/>

     Shall do a court'sy to our wrath, which men<br/>

     May blame, but not control.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00184">            Enter Gloucester, brought in by two or three.</p>

<p id="id00185">     Who's there? the traitor?<br/>

  Reg. Ingrateful fox! 'tis he.<br/>

  Corn. Bind fast his corky arms.<br/>

  Glou. What mean, your Graces? Good my friends, consider<br/>

     You are my guests. Do me no foul play, friends.<br/>

  Corn. Bind him, I say.<br/>

                                            [Servants bind him.]<br/>

  Reg. Hard, hard. O filthy traitor!<br/>

  Glou. Unmerciful lady as you are, I am none.<br/>

  Corn. To this chair bind him. Villain, thou shalt find-<br/>

                                       [Regan plucks his beard.]<br/>

  Glou. By the kind gods, 'tis most ignobly done<br/>

     To pluck me by the beard.<br/>

  Reg. So white, and such a traitor!<br/>

  Glou. Naughty lady,<br/>

     These hairs which thou dost ravish from my chin<br/>

     Will quicken, and accuse thee. I am your host.<br/>

     With robber's hands my hospitable favours<br/>

     You should not ruffle thus. What will you do?<br/>

  Corn. Come, sir, what letters had you late from France?<br/>

  Reg. Be simple-answer'd, for we know the truth.<br/>

  Corn. And what confederacy have you with the traitors<br/>

     Late footed in the kingdom?<br/>

  Reg. To whose hands have you sent the lunatic King?<br/>

     Speak.<br/>

  Glou. I have a letter guessingly set down,<br/>

     Which came from one that's of a neutral heart,<br/>

     And not from one oppos'd.<br/>

  Corn. Cunning.<br/>

  Reg. And false.<br/>

  Corn. Where hast thou sent the King?<br/>

  Glou. To Dover.<br/>

  Reg. Wherefore to Dover? Wast thou not charg'd at peril-<br/>

  Corn. Wherefore to Dover? Let him first answer that.<br/>

  Glou. I am tied to th' stake, and I must stand the course.<br/>

  Reg. Wherefore to Dover, sir?<br/>

  Glou. Because I would not see thy cruel nails<br/>

     Pluck out his poor old eyes; nor thy fierce sister<br/>

     In his anointed flesh stick boarish fangs.<br/>

     The sea, with such a storm as his bare head<br/>

     In hell-black night endur'd, would have buoy'd up<br/>

     And quench'd the steeled fires.<br/>

     Yet, poor old heart, he holp the heavens to rain.<br/>

     If wolves had at thy gate howl'd that stern time,<br/>

     Thou shouldst have said, 'Good porter, turn the key.'<br/>

     All cruels else subscrib'd. But I shall see<br/>

     The winged vengeance overtake such children.<br/>

  Corn. See't shalt thou never. Fellows, hold the chair.<br/>

     Upon these eyes of thine I'll set my foot.<br/>

  Glou. He that will think to live till he be old,<br/>

     Give me some help!- O cruel! O ye gods!<br/>

  Reg. One side will mock another. Th' other too!<br/>

  Corn. If you see vengeance-<br/>

  1. Serv. Hold your hand, my lord!<br/>

     I have serv'd you ever since I was a child;<br/>

     But better service have I never done you<br/>

     Than now to bid you hold.<br/>

  Reg. How now, you dog?<br/>

  1. Serv. If you did wear a beard upon your chin,<br/>

     I'ld shake it on this quarrel.<br/>

  Reg. What do you mean?<br/>

  Corn. My villain!                               Draw and fight.<br/>

  1. Serv. Nay, then, come on, and take the chance of anger.<br/>

  Reg. Give me thy sword. A peasant stand up thus?<br/>

                        She takes a sword and runs at him behind.<br/>

  1. Serv. O, I am slain! My lord, you have one eye left<br/>

     To see some mischief on him. O!                     He dies.<br/>

  Corn. Lest it see more, prevent it. Out, vile jelly!<br/>

     Where is thy lustre now?<br/>

  Glou. All dark and comfortless! Where's my son Edmund?<br/>

     Edmund, enkindle all the sparks of nature<br/>

     To quit this horrid act.<br/>

  Reg. Out, treacherous villain!<br/>

     Thou call'st on him that hates thee. It was he<br/>

     That made the overture of thy treasons to us;<br/>

     Who is too good to pity thee.<br/>

  Glou. O my follies! Then Edgar was abus'd.<br/>

     Kind gods, forgive me that, and prosper him!<br/>

  Reg. Go thrust him out at gates, and let him smell<br/>

     His way to Dover.<br/>

                                     Exit [one] with Gloucester.<br/>

     How is't, my lord? How look you?<br/>

  Corn. I have receiv'd a hurt. Follow me, lady.<br/>

     Turn out that eyeless villain. Throw this slave<br/>

     Upon the dunghill. Regan, I bleed apace.<br/>

     Untimely comes this hurt. Give me your arm.<br/>

                                  Exit [Cornwall, led by Regan].<br/>

  2. Serv. I'll never care what wickedness I do,<br/>

     If this man come to good.<br/>

  3. Serv. If she live long,<br/>

     And in the end meet the old course of death,<br/>

     Women will all turn monsters.<br/>

  2. Serv. Let's follow the old Earl, and get the bedlam<br/>

     To lead him where he would. His roguish madness<br/>

     Allows itself to anything.<br/>

  3. Serv. Go thou. I'll fetch some flax and whites of eggs<br/>

     To apply to his bleeding face. Now heaven help him!<br/>

                                                         Exeunt.<br/>

The heath.</h3>

<p id="id00188">Enter Edgar.</p>

<p id="id00189">  Edg. Yet better thus, and known to be contemn'd,<br/>

     Than still contemn'd and flatter'd. To be worst,<br/>

     The lowest and most dejected thing of fortune,<br/>

     Stands still in esperance, lives not in fear.<br/>

     The lamentable change is from the best;<br/>

     The worst returns to laughter. Welcome then,<br/>

     Thou unsubstantial air that I embrace!<br/>

     The wretch that thou hast blown unto the worst<br/>

     Owes nothing to thy blasts.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00190">                 Enter Gloucester, led by an Old Man.</p>

<p id="id00191">     But who comes here?<br/>

     My father, poorly led? World, world, O world!<br/>

     But that thy strange mutations make us hate thee,<br/>

     Life would not yield to age.<br/>

  Old Man. O my good lord,<br/>

     I have been your tenant, and your father's tenant,<br/>

     These fourscore years.<br/>

  Glou. Away, get thee away! Good friend, be gone.<br/>

     Thy comforts can do me no good at all;<br/>

     Thee they may hurt.<br/>

  Old Man. You cannot see your way.<br/>

  Glou. I have no way, and therefore want no eyes;<br/>

     I stumbled when I saw. Full oft 'tis seen<br/>

     Our means secure us, and our mere defects<br/>

     Prove our commodities. Ah dear son Edgar,<br/>

     The food of thy abused father's wrath!<br/>

     Might I but live to see thee in my touch,<br/>

     I'ld say I had eyes again!<br/>

  Old Man. How now? Who's there?<br/>

  Edg. [aside] O gods! Who is't can say 'I am at the worst'?<br/>

     I am worse than e'er I was.<br/>

  Old Man. 'Tis poor mad Tom.<br/>

  Edg. [aside] And worse I may be yet. The worst is not<br/>

     So long as we can say 'This is the worst.'<br/>

  Old Man. Fellow, where goest?<br/>

  Glou. Is it a beggarman?<br/>

  Old Man. Madman and beggar too.<br/>

  Glou. He has some reason, else he could not beg.<br/>

     I' th' last night's storm I such a fellow saw,<br/>

     Which made me think a man a worm. My son<br/>

     Came then into my mind, and yet my mind<br/>

     Was then scarce friends with him. I have heard more since.<br/>

     As flies to wanton boys are we to th' gods.<br/>

     They kill us for their sport.<br/>

  Edg. [aside] How should this be?<br/>

     Bad is the trade that must play fool to sorrow,<br/>

     Ang'ring itself and others.- Bless thee, master!<br/>

  Glou. Is that the naked fellow?<br/>

  Old Man. Ay, my lord.<br/>

  Glou. Then prithee get thee gone. If for my sake<br/>

     Thou wilt o'ertake us hence a mile or twain<br/>

     I' th' way toward Dover, do it for ancient love;<br/>

     And bring some covering for this naked soul,<br/>

     Who I'll entreat to lead me.<br/>

  Old Man. Alack, sir, he is mad!<br/>

  Glou. 'Tis the time's plague when madmen lead the blind.<br/>

     Do as I bid thee, or rather do thy pleasure.<br/>

     Above the rest, be gone.<br/>

  Old Man. I'll bring him the best 'parel that I have,<br/>

     Come on't what will.                                  Exit.<br/>

  Glou. Sirrah naked fellow-<br/>

  Edg. Poor Tom's acold. [Aside] I cannot daub it further.<br/>

  Glou. Come hither, fellow.<br/>

  Edg. [aside] And yet I must.- Bless thy sweet eyes, they bleed.<br/>

  Glou. Know'st thou the way to Dover?<br/>

  Edg. Both stile and gate, horseway and footpath. Poor Tom hath<br/>

been<br/>

     scar'd out of his good wits. Bless thee, good man's son,<br/>

from<br/>

     the foul fiend! Five fiends have been in poor Tom at once:<br/>

of<br/>

     lust, as Obidicut; Hobbididence, prince of dumbness; Mahu,<br/>

of<br/>

     stealing; Modo, of murder; Flibbertigibbet, of mopping and<br/>

     mowing, who since possesses chambermaids and waiting women.<br/>

So,<br/>

     bless thee, master!<br/>

  Glou. Here, take this purse, thou whom the heavens' plagues<br/>

     Have humbled to all strokes. That I am wretched<br/>

     Makes thee the happier. Heavens, deal so still!<br/>

     Let the superfluous and lust-dieted man,<br/>

     That slaves your ordinance, that will not see<br/>

     Because he does not feel, feel your pow'r quickly;<br/>

     So distribution should undo excess,<br/>

     And each man have enough. Dost thou know Dover?<br/>

  Edg. Ay, master.<br/>

  Glou. There is a cliff, whose high and bending head<br/>

     Looks fearfully in the confined deep.<br/>

     Bring me but to the very brim of it,<br/>

     And I'll repair the misery thou dost bear<br/>

     With something rich about me. From that place<br/>

     I shall no leading need.<br/>

  Edg. Give me thy arm.<br/>

     Poor Tom shall lead thee.<br/>

                                                         Exeunt.<br/>

<h2 id="id00192" style="margin-top: 4em">Scene II.
Before the Duke of Albany's Palace.</h2>

<p id="id00193">Enter Goneril and [Edmund the] Bastard.</p>

<p id="id00194">  Gon. Welcome, my lord. I marvel our mild husband<br/>

     Not met us on the way.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00195">                     Enter [Oswald the] Steward.</p>

<p id="id00196">     Now, where's your master?<br/>

  Osw. Madam, within, but never man so chang'd.<br/>

     I told him of the army that was landed:<br/>

     He smil'd at it. I told him you were coming:<br/>

     His answer was, 'The worse.' Of Gloucester's treachery<br/>

     And of the loyal service of his son<br/>

     When I inform'd him, then he call'd me sot<br/>

     And told me I had turn'd the wrong side out.<br/>

     What most he should dislike seems pleasant to him;<br/>

     What like, offensive.<br/>

  Gon. [to Edmund] Then shall you go no further.<br/>

     It is the cowish terror of his spirit,<br/>

     That dares not undertake. He'll not feel wrongs<br/>

     Which tie him to an answer. Our wishes on the way<br/>

     May prove effects. Back, Edmund, to my brother.<br/>

     Hasten his musters and conduct his pow'rs.<br/>

     I must change arms at home and give the distaff<br/>

     Into my husband's hands. This trusty servant<br/>

     Shall pass between us. Ere long you are like to hear<br/>

     (If you dare venture in your own behalf)<br/>

     A mistress's command. Wear this.          [Gives a favour.]<br/>

     Spare speech.<br/>

     Decline your head. This kiss, if it durst speak,<br/>

     Would stretch thy spirits up into the air.<br/>

     Conceive, and fare thee well.<br/>

  Edm. Yours in the ranks of death!                        Exit.<br/>

  Gon. My most dear Gloucester!<br/>

     O, the difference of man and man!<br/>

     To thee a woman's services are due;<br/>

     My fool usurps my body.<br/>

  Osw. Madam, here comes my lord.                          Exit.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00197">                            Enter Albany.</p>

<p id="id00198">  Gon. I have been worth the whistle.<br/>

  Alb. O Goneril,<br/>

     You are not worth the dust which the rude wind<br/>

     Blows in your face! I fear your disposition.<br/>

     That nature which contemns it origin<br/>

     Cannot be bordered certain in itself.<br/>

     She that herself will sliver and disbranch<br/>

     From her material sap, perforce must wither<br/>

     And come to deadly use.<br/>

  Gon. No more! The text is foolish.<br/>

  Alb. Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile;<br/>

     Filths savour but themselves. What have you done?<br/>

     Tigers, not daughters, what have you perform'd?<br/>

     A father, and a gracious aged man,<br/>

     Whose reverence even the head-lugg'd bear would lick,<br/>

     Most barbarous, most degenerate, have you madded.<br/>

     Could my good brother suffer you to do it?<br/>

     A man, a prince, by him so benefited!<br/>

     If that the heavens do not their visible spirits<br/>

     Send quickly down to tame these vile offences,<br/>

     It will come,<br/>

     Humanity must perforce prey on itself,<br/>

     Like monsters of the deep.<br/>

  Gon. Milk-liver'd man!<br/>

     That bear'st a cheek for blows, a head for wrongs;<br/>

     Who hast not in thy brows an eye discerning<br/>

     Thine honour from thy suffering; that not know'st<br/>

     Fools do those villains pity who are punish'd<br/>

     Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?<br/>

     France spreads his banners in our noiseless land,<br/>

     With plumed helm thy state begins to threat,<br/>

     Whiles thou, a moral fool, sit'st still, and criest<br/>

     'Alack, why does he so?'<br/>

  Alb. See thyself, devil!<br/>

     Proper deformity seems not in the fiend<br/>

     So horrid as in woman.<br/>

  Gon. O vain fool!<br/>

  Alb. Thou changed and self-cover'd thing, for shame!<br/>

     Bemonster not thy feature! Were't my fitness<br/>

     To let these hands obey my blood,<br/>

     They are apt enough to dislocate and tear<br/>

     Thy flesh and bones. Howe'er thou art a fiend,<br/>

     A woman's shape doth shield thee.<br/>

  Gon. Marry, your manhood mew!<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00199">                          Enter a Gentleman.</p>

<p id="id00200">  Alb. What news?<br/>

  Gent. O, my good lord, the Duke of Cornwall 's dead,<br/>

     Slain by his servant, going to put out<br/>

     The other eye of Gloucester.<br/>

  Alb. Gloucester's eyes?<br/>

  Gent. A servant that he bred, thrill'd with remorse,<br/>

     Oppos'd against the act, bending his sword<br/>

     To his great master; who, thereat enrag'd,<br/>

     Flew on him, and amongst them fell'd him dead;<br/>

     But not without that harmful stroke which since<br/>

     Hath pluck'd him after.<br/>

  Alb. This shows you are above,<br/>

     You justicers, that these our nether crimes<br/>

     So speedily can venge! But O poor Gloucester!<br/>

     Lose he his other eye?<br/>

  Gent. Both, both, my lord.<br/>

     This letter, madam, craves a speedy answer.<br/>

     'Tis from your sister.<br/>

  Gon. [aside] One way I like this well;<br/>

     But being widow, and my Gloucester with her,<br/>

     May all the building in my fancy pluck<br/>

     Upon my hateful life. Another way<br/>

     The news is not so tart.- I'll read, and answer.<br/>

Exit.<br/>

  Alb. Where was his son when they did take his eyes?<br/>

  Gent. Come with my lady hither.<br/>

  Alb. He is not here.<br/>

  Gent. No, my good lord; I met him back again.<br/>

  Alb. Knows he the wickedness?<br/>

  Gent. Ay, my good lord. 'Twas he inform'd against him,<br/>

     And quit the house on purpose, that their punishment<br/>

     Might have the freer course.<br/>

  Alb. Gloucester, I live<br/>

     To thank thee for the love thou show'dst the King,<br/>

     And to revenge thine eyes. Come hither, friend.<br/>

     Tell me what more thou know'st.<br/>

                                                         Exeunt.<br/>

<h2 id="id00201" style="margin-top: 4em">Scene III.
The French camp near Dover.</h2>

<p id="id00202">Enter Kent and a Gentleman.</p>

<p id="id00203">  Kent. Why the King of France is so suddenly gone back know you<br/>

the<br/>

     reason?<br/>

  Gent. Something he left imperfect in the state, which since his<br/>

     coming forth is thought of, which imports to the kingdom so<br/>

much<br/>

     fear and danger that his personal return was most required<br/>

and<br/>

     necessary.<br/>

  Kent. Who hath he left behind him general?<br/>

  Gent. The Marshal of France, Monsieur La Far.<br/>

  Kent. Did your letters pierce the Queen to any demonstration of<br/>

     grief?<br/>

  Gent. Ay, sir. She took them, read them in my presence,<br/>

     And now and then an ample tear trill'd down<br/>

     Her delicate cheek. It seem'd she was a queen<br/>

     Over her passion, who, most rebel-like,<br/>

     Sought to be king o'er her.<br/>

  Kent. O, then it mov'd her?<br/>

  Gent. Not to a rage. Patience and sorrow strove<br/>

     Who should express her goodliest. You have seen<br/>

     Sunshine and rain at once: her smiles and tears<br/>

     Were like, a better way. Those happy smilets<br/>

     That play'd on her ripe lip seem'd not to know<br/>

     What guests were in her eyes, which parted thence<br/>

     As pearls from diamonds dropp'd. In brief,<br/>

     Sorrow would be a rarity most belov'd,<br/>

     If all could so become it.<br/>

  Kent. Made she no verbal question?<br/>

  Gent. Faith, once or twice she heav'd the name of father<br/>

     Pantingly forth, as if it press'd her heart;<br/>

     Cried 'Sisters, sisters! Shame of ladies! Sisters!<br/>

     Kent! father! sisters! What, i' th' storm? i' th' night?<br/>

     Let pity not be believ'd!' There she shook<br/>

     The holy water from her heavenly eyes,<br/>

     And clamour moisten'd. Then away she started<br/>

     To deal with grief alone.<br/>

  Kent. It is the stars,<br/>

     The stars above us, govern our conditions;<br/>

     Else one self mate and mate could not beget<br/>

     Such different issues. You spoke not with her since?<br/>

  Gent. No.<br/>

  Kent. Was this before the King return'd?<br/>

  Gent. No, since.<br/>

  Kent. Well, sir, the poor distressed Lear's i' th' town;<br/>

     Who sometime, in his better tune, remembers<br/>

     What we are come about, and by no means<br/>

     Will yield to see his daughter.<br/>

  Gent. Why, good sir?<br/>

  Kent. A sovereign shame so elbows him; his own unkindness,<br/>

     That stripp'd her from his benediction, turn'd her<br/>

     To foreign casualties, gave her dear rights<br/>

     To his dog-hearted daughters- these things sting<br/>

     His mind so venomously that burning shame<br/>

     Detains him from Cordelia.<br/>

  Gent. Alack, poor gentleman!<br/>

  Kent. Of Albany's and Cornwall's powers you heard not?<br/>

  Gent. 'Tis so; they are afoot.<br/>

  Kent. Well, sir, I'll bring you to our master Lear<br/>

     And leave you to attend him. Some dear cause<br/>

     Will in concealment wrap me up awhile.<br/>

     When I am known aright, you shall not grieve<br/>

     Lending me this acquaintance. I pray you go<br/>

     Along with me.                                      Exeunt.<br/>

     Therefore great France<br/>

     My mourning and important tears hath pitied.<br/>

     No blown ambition doth our arms incite,<br/>

     But love, dear love, and our ag'd father's right.<br/>

     Soon may I hear and see him!<br/>

                                                         Exeunt.<br/>

<h2 id="id00209" style="margin-top: 4em">Scene V.
Gloucester's Castle.</h2>

<p id="id00210">Enter Regan and [Oswald the] Steward.</p>

<p id="id00211">  Reg. But are my brother's pow'rs set forth?<br/>

  Osw. Ay, madam.<br/>

  Reg. Himself in person there?<br/>

  Osw. Madam, with much ado.<br/>

     Your sister is the better soldier.<br/>

  Reg. Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home?<br/>

  Osw. No, madam.<br/>

  Reg. What might import my sister's letter to him?<br/>

  Osw. I know not, lady.<br/>

  Reg. Faith, he is posted hence on serious matter.<br/>

     It was great ignorance, Gloucester's eyes being out,<br/>

     To let him live. Where he arrives he moves<br/>

     All hearts against us. Edmund, I think, is gone,<br/>

     In pity of his misery, to dispatch<br/>

     His nighted life; moreover, to descry<br/>

     The strength o' th' enemy.<br/>

  Osw. I must needs after him, madam, with my letter.<br/>

  Reg. Our troops set forth to-morrow. Stay with us.<br/>

     The ways are dangerous.<br/>

  Osw. I may not, madam.<br/>

     My lady charg'd my duty in this business.<br/>

  Reg. Why should she write to Edmund? Might not you<br/>

     Transport her purposes by word? Belike,<br/>

     Something- I know not what- I'll love thee much-<br/>

     Let me unseal the letter.<br/>

  Osw. Madam, I had rather-<br/>

  Reg. I know your lady does not love her husband;<br/>

     I am sure of that; and at her late being here<br/>

     She gave strange eyeliads and most speaking looks<br/>

     To noble Edmund. I know you are of her bosom.<br/>

  Osw. I, madam?<br/>

  Reg. I speak in understanding. Y'are! I know't.<br/>

     Therefore I do advise you take this note.<br/>

     My lord is dead; Edmund and I have talk'd,<br/>

     And more convenient is he for my hand<br/>

     Than for your lady's. You may gather more.<br/>

     If you do find him, pray you give him this;<br/>

     And when your mistress hears thus much from you,<br/>

     I pray desire her call her wisdom to her.<br/>

     So farewell.<br/>

     If you do chance to hear of that blind traitor,<br/>

     Preferment falls on him that cuts him off.<br/>

  Osw. Would I could meet him, madam! I should show<br/>

     What party I do follow.<br/>

  Reg. Fare thee well.                                   Exeunt.<br/>

<h2 id="id00212" style="margin-top: 4em">Scene VI.
The country near Dover.</h2>

<p id="id00213">Enter Gloucester, and Edgar [like a Peasant].</p>

<p id="id00214">  Glou. When shall I come to th' top of that same hill?<br/>

  Edg. You do climb up it now. Look how we labour.<br/>

  Glou. Methinks the ground is even.<br/>

  Edg. Horrible steep.<br/>

     Hark, do you hear the sea?<br/>

  Glou. No, truly.<br/>

  Edg. Why, then, your other senses grow imperfect<br/>

     By your eyes' anguish.<br/>

  Glou. So may it be indeed.<br/>

     Methinks thy voice is alter'd, and thou speak'st<br/>

     In better phrase and matter than thou didst.<br/>

  Edg. Y'are much deceiv'd. In nothing am I chang'd<br/>

     But in my garments.<br/>

  Glou. Methinks y'are better spoken.<br/>

  Edg. Come on, sir; here's the place. Stand still. How fearful<br/>

     And dizzy 'tis to cast one's eyes so low!<br/>

     The crows and choughs that wing the midway air<br/>

     Show scarce so gross as beetles. Halfway down<br/>

     Hangs one that gathers sampire- dreadful trade!<br/>

     Methinks he seems no bigger than his head.<br/>

     The fishermen that walk upon the beach<br/>

     Appear like mice; and yond tall anchoring bark,<br/>

     Diminish'd to her cock; her cock, a buoy<br/>

     Almost too small for sight. The murmuring surge<br/>

     That on th' unnumb'red idle pebble chafes<br/>

     Cannot be heard so high. I'll look no more,<br/>

     Lest my brain turn, and the deficient sight<br/>

     Topple down headlong.<br/>

  Glou. Set me where you stand.<br/>

  Edg. Give me your hand. You are now within a foot<br/>

     Of th' extreme verge. For all beneath the moon<br/>

     Would I not leap upright.<br/>

  Glou. Let go my hand.<br/>

     Here, friend, is another purse; in it a jewel<br/>

     Well worth a poor man's taking. Fairies and gods<br/>

     Prosper it with thee! Go thou further off;<br/>

     Bid me farewell, and let me hear thee going.<br/>

  Edg. Now fare ye well, good sir.<br/>

  Glou. With all my heart.<br/>

  Edg. [aside]. Why I do trifle thus with his despair<br/>

     Is done to cure it.<br/>

  Glou. O you mighty gods!                            He kneels.<br/>

     This world I do renounce, and, in your sights,<br/>

     Shake patiently my great affliction off.<br/>

     If I could bear it longer and not fall<br/>

     To quarrel with your great opposeless wills,<br/>

     My snuff and loathed part of nature should<br/>

     Burn itself out. If Edgar live, O, bless him!<br/>

     Now, fellow, fare thee well.<br/>

                                  He falls [forward and swoons].<br/>

  Edg. Gone, sir, farewell.-<br/>

     And yet I know not how conceit may rob<br/>

     The treasury of life when life itself<br/>

     Yields to the theft. Had he been where he thought,<br/>

     By this had thought been past.- Alive or dead?<br/>

     Ho you, sir! friend! Hear you, sir? Speak!-<br/>

     Thus might he pass indeed. Yet he revives.<br/>

     What are you, sir?<br/>

  Glou. Away, and let me die.<br/>

  Edg. Hadst thou been aught but gossamer, feathers, air,<br/>

     So many fadom down precipitating,<br/>

     Thou'dst shiver'd like an egg; but thou dost breathe;<br/>

     Hast heavy substance; bleed'st not; speak'st; art sound.<br/>

     Ten masts at each make not the altitude<br/>

     Which thou hast perpendicularly fell.<br/>

     Thy life is a miracle. Speak yet again.<br/>

  Glou. But have I fall'n, or no?<br/>

  Edg. From the dread summit of this chalky bourn.<br/>

     Look up a-height. The shrill-gorg'd lark so far<br/>

     Cannot be seen or heard. Do but look up.<br/>

  Glou. Alack, I have no eyes!<br/>

     Is wretchedness depriv'd that benefit<br/>

     To end itself by death? 'Twas yet some comfort<br/>

     When misery could beguile the tyrant's rage<br/>

     And frustrate his proud will.<br/>

  Edg. Give me your arm.<br/>

     Up- so. How is't? Feel you your legs? You stand.<br/>

  Glou. Too well, too well.<br/>

  Edg. This is above all strangeness.<br/>

     Upon the crown o' th' cliff what thing was that<br/>

     Which parted from you?<br/>

  Glou. A poor unfortunate beggar.<br/>

  Edg. As I stood here below, methought his eyes<br/>

     Were two full moons; he had a thousand noses,<br/>

     Horns whelk'd and wav'd like the enridged sea.<br/>

     It was some fiend. Therefore, thou happy father,<br/>

     Think that the clearest gods, who make them honours<br/>

     Of men's impossibility, have preserv'd thee.<br/>

  Glou. I do remember now. Henceforth I'll bear<br/>

     Affliction till it do cry out itself<br/>

     'Enough, enough,' and die. That thing you speak of,<br/>

     I took it for a man. Often 'twould say<br/>

     'The fiend, the fiend'- he led me to that place.<br/>

  Edg. Bear free and patient thoughts.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00215">         Enter Lear, mad, [fantastically dressed with weeds].</p>

<p id="id00216">     But who comes here?<br/>

     The safer sense will ne'er accommodate<br/>

     His master thus.<br/>

  Lear. No, they cannot touch me for coming;<br/>

     I am the King himself.<br/>

  Edg. O thou side-piercing sight!<br/>

  Lear. Nature 's above art in that respect. There's your press<br/>

     money. That fellow handles his bow like a crow-keeper. Draw<br/>

me<br/>

     a clothier's yard. Look, look, a mouse! Peace, peace; this<br/>

piece<br/>

     of toasted cheese will do't. There's my gauntlet; I'll prove<br/>

it<br/>

     on a giant. Bring up the brown bills. O, well flown, bird!<br/>

i'<br/>

     th' clout, i' th' clout! Hewgh! Give the word.<br/>

  Edg. Sweet marjoram.<br/>

  Lear. Pass.<br/>

  Glou. I know that voice.<br/>

  Lear. Ha! Goneril with a white beard? They flatter'd me like a<br/>

dog,<br/>

     and told me I had white hairs in my beard ere the black ones<br/>

     were there. To say 'ay' and 'no' to everything I said! 'Ay'<br/>

and<br/>

     'no' too was no good divinity. When the rain came to wet me<br/>

     once, and the wind to make me chatter; when the thunder<br/>

would<br/>

     not peace at my bidding; there I found 'em, there I smelt<br/>

'em<br/>

     out. Go to, they are not men o' their words! They told me I<br/>

was<br/>

     everything. 'Tis a lie- I am not ague-proof.<br/>

  Glou. The trick of that voice I do well remember.<br/>

     Is't not the King?<br/>

  Lear. Ay, every inch a king!<br/>

     When I do stare, see how the subject quakes.<br/>

     I pardon that man's life. What was thy cause?<br/>

     Adultery?<br/>

     Thou shalt not die. Die for adultery? No.<br/>

     The wren goes to't, and the small gilded fly<br/>

     Does lecher in my sight.<br/>

     Let copulation thrive; for Gloucester's bastard son<br/>

     Was kinder to his father than my daughters<br/>

     Got 'tween the lawful sheets.<br/>

     To't, luxury, pell-mell! for I lack soldiers.<br/>

     Behold yond simp'ring dame,<br/>

     Whose face between her forks presageth snow,<br/>

     That minces virtue, and does shake the head<br/>

     To hear of pleasure's name.<br/>

     The fitchew nor the soiled horse goes to't<br/>

     With a more riotous appetite.<br/>

     Down from the waist they are Centaurs,<br/>

     Though women all above.<br/>

     But to the girdle do the gods inherit,<br/>

     Beneath is all the fiend's.<br/>

     There's hell, there's darkness, there's the sulphurous pit;<br/>

     burning, scalding, stench, consumption. Fie, fie, fie! pah,<br/>

pah!<br/>

     Give me an ounce of civet, good apothecary, to sweeten my<br/>

     imagination. There's money for thee.<br/>

  Glou. O, let me kiss that hand!<br/>

  Lear. Let me wipe it first; it smells of mortality.<br/>

  Glou. O ruin'd piece of nature! This great world<br/>

     Shall so wear out to naught. Dost thou know me?<br/>

  Lear. I remember thine eyes well enough. Dost thou squiny at<br/>

me?<br/>

     No, do thy worst, blind Cupid! I'll not love. Read thou this<br/>

     challenge; mark but the penning of it.<br/>

  Glou. Were all the letters suns, I could not see one.<br/>

  Edg. [aside] I would not take this from report. It is,<br/>

     And my heart breaks at it.<br/>

  Lear. Read.<br/>

  Glou. What, with the case of eyes?<br/>

  Lear. O, ho, are you there with me? No eyes in your head, nor<br/>

no<br/>

     money in your purse? Your eyes are in a heavy case, your<br/>

purse<br/>

     in a light. Yet you see how this world goes.<br/>

  Glou. I see it feelingly.<br/>

  Lear. What, art mad? A man may see how the world goes with no<br/>

eyes.<br/>

     Look with thine ears. See how yond justice rails upon yond<br/>

     simple thief. Hark in thine ear. Change places and,<br/>

handy-dandy,<br/>

     which is the justice, which is the thief? Thou hast seen a<br/>

     farmer's dog bark at a beggar?<br/>

  Glou. Ay, sir.<br/>

  Lear. And the creature run from the cur? There thou mightst<br/>

behold<br/>

     the great image of authority: a dog's obeyed in office.<br/>

     Thou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand!<br/>

     Why dost thou lash that whore? Strip thine own back.<br/>

     Thou hotly lusts to use her in that kind<br/>

     For which thou whip'st her. The usurer hangs the cozener.<br/>

     Through tatter'd clothes small vices do appear;<br/>

     Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,<br/>

     And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks;<br/>

     Arm it in rags, a pygmy's straw does pierce it.<br/>

     None does offend, none- I say none! I'll able 'em.<br/>

     Take that of me, my friend, who have the power<br/>

     To seal th' accuser's lips. Get thee glass eyes<br/>

     And, like a scurvy politician, seem<br/>

     To see the things thou dost not. Now, now, now, now!<br/>

     Pull off my boots. Harder, harder! So.<br/>

  Edg. O, matter and impertinency mix'd!<br/>

     Reason, in madness!<br/>

  Lear. If thou wilt weep my fortunes, take my eyes.<br/>

     I know thee well enough; thy name is Gloucester.<br/>

     Thou must be patient. We came crying hither;<br/>

     Thou know'st, the first time that we smell the air<br/>

     We wawl and cry. I will preach to thee. Mark.<br/>

  Glou. Alack, alack the day!<br/>

  Lear. When we are born, we cry that we are come<br/>

     To this great stage of fools. This' a good block.<br/>

     It were a delicate stratagem to shoe<br/>

     A troop of horse with felt. I'll put't in proof,<br/>

     And when I have stol'n upon these sons-in-law,<br/>

     Then kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!<br/>
