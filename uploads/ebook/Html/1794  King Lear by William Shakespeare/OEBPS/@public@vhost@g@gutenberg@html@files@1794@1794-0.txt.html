<p id="id00014">We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar, then we produce 2
million dollars per hour this year we, will have to do four text
files per month:  thus upping our productivity from one million.
The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is 10% of the expected number of computer users by the end
of the year 2001.</p>

<h4 id="id00050" style="margin-top: 2em">ACT I. Scene I.
[King Lear's Palace.]</h4>

<p id="id00051">Enter Kent, Gloucester, and Edmund. [Kent and Glouceste converse.<br/>

Edmund stands back.]<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00052">  Kent. I thought the King had more affected the Duke of Albany<br/>

than<br/>

     Cornwall.<br/>

  Glou. It did always seem so to us; but now, in the division of<br/>

the<br/>

     kingdom, it appears not which of the Dukes he values most,<br/>

for<br/>

     equalities are so weigh'd that curiosity in neither can make<br/>

     choice of either's moiety.<br/>

  Kent. Is not this your son, my lord?<br/>

  Glou. His breeding, sir, hath been at my charge. I have so<br/>

often<br/>

     blush'd to acknowledge him that now I am braz'd to't.<br/>

  Kent. I cannot conceive you.<br/>

  Glou. Sir, this young fellow's mother could; whereupon she grew<br/>

     round-womb'd, and had indeed, sir, a son for her cradle ere<br/>

she<br/>

     had a husband for her bed. Do you smell a fault?<br/>

  Kent. I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it being so<br/>

     proper.<br/>

  Glou. But I have, sir, a son by order of law, some year elder<br/>

than<br/>

     this, who yet is no dearer in my account. Though this knave<br/>

came<br/>

     something saucily into the world before he was sent for, yet<br/>

was<br/>

     his mother fair, there was good sport at his making, and the<br/>

     whoreson must be acknowledged.- Do you know this noble<br/>

gentleman,<br/>

     Edmund?<br/>

  Edm. [comes forward] No, my lord.<br/>

  Glou. My Lord of Kent. Remember him hereafter as my honourable<br/>

     friend.<br/>

  Edm. My services to your lordship.<br/>

  Kent. I must love you, and sue to know you better.<br/>

  Edm. Sir, I shall study deserving.<br/>

  Glou. He hath been out nine years, and away he shall again.<br/>

                                                 Sound a sennet.<br/>

     The King is coming.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00053">      Enter one bearing a coronet; then Lear; then the Dukes of<br/>

      Albany and Cornwall; next, Goneril, Regan, Cordelia, with<br/>

                              Followers.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00054">  Lear. Attend the lords of France and Burgundy, Gloucester.<br/>

  Glou. I shall, my liege.<br/>

                                 Exeunt [Gloucester and Edmund].<br/>

  Lear. Meantime we shall express our darker purpose.<br/>

     Give me the map there. Know we have divided<br/>

     In three our kingdom; and 'tis our fast intent<br/>

     To shake all cares and business from our age,<br/>

     Conferring them on younger strengths while we<br/>

     Unburthen'd crawl toward death. Our son of Cornwall,<br/>

     And you, our no less loving son of Albany,<br/>

     We have this hour a constant will to publish<br/>

     Our daughters' several dowers, that future strife<br/>

     May be prevented now. The princes, France and Burgundy,<br/>

     Great rivals in our youngest daughter's love,<br/>

     Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn,<br/>

     And here are to be answer'd. Tell me, my daughters<br/>

     (Since now we will divest us both of rule,<br/>

     Interest of territory, cares of state),<br/>

     Which of you shall we say doth love us most?<br/>

     That we our largest bounty may extend<br/>

     Where nature doth with merit challenge. Goneril,<br/>

     Our eldest-born, speak first.<br/>

  Gon. Sir, I love you more than words can wield the matter;<br/>

     Dearer than eyesight, space, and liberty;<br/>

     Beyond what can be valued, rich or rare;<br/>

     No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honour;<br/>

     As much as child e'er lov'd, or father found;<br/>

     A love that makes breath poor, and speech unable.<br/>

     Beyond all manner of so much I love you.<br/>

  Cor. [aside] What shall Cordelia speak? Love, and be silent.<br/>

  Lear. Of all these bounds, even from this line to this,<br/>

     With shadowy forests and with champains rich'd,<br/>

     With plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads,<br/>

     We make thee lady. To thine and Albany's issue<br/>

     Be this perpetual.- What says our second daughter,<br/>

     Our dearest Regan, wife to Cornwall? Speak.<br/>

  Reg. Sir, I am made<br/>

     Of the selfsame metal that my sister is,<br/>

     And prize me at her worth. In my true heart<br/>

     I find she names my very deed of love;<br/>

     Only she comes too short, that I profess<br/>

     Myself an enemy to all other joys<br/>

     Which the most precious square of sense possesses,<br/>

     And find I am alone felicitate<br/>

     In your dear Highness' love.<br/>

  Cor. [aside] Then poor Cordelia!<br/>

     And yet not so; since I am sure my love's<br/>

     More richer than my tongue.<br/>

  Lear. To thee and thine hereditary ever<br/>

     Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom,<br/>

     No less in space, validity, and pleasure<br/>

     Than that conferr'd on Goneril.- Now, our joy,<br/>

     Although the last, not least; to whose young love<br/>

     The vines of France and milk of Burgundy<br/>

     Strive to be interest; what can you say to draw<br/>

     A third more opulent than your sisters? Speak.<br/>

  Cor. Nothing, my lord.<br/>

  Lear. Nothing?<br/>

  Cor. Nothing.<br/>

  Lear. Nothing can come of nothing. Speak again.<br/>

  Cor. Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave<br/>

     My heart into my mouth. I love your Majesty<br/>

     According to my bond; no more nor less.<br/>

  Lear. How, how, Cordelia? Mend your speech a little,<br/>

     Lest it may mar your fortunes.<br/>

  Cor. Good my lord,<br/>

     You have begot me, bred me, lov'd me; I<br/>

     Return those duties back as are right fit,<br/>

     Obey you, love you, and most honour you.<br/>

     Why have my sisters husbands, if they say<br/>

     They love you all? Haply, when I shall wed,<br/>

     That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry<br/>

     Half my love with him, half my care and duty.<br/>

     Sure I shall never marry like my sisters,<br/>

     To love my father all.<br/>

  Lear. But goes thy heart with this?<br/>

  Cor. Ay, good my lord.<br/>

  Lear. So young, and so untender?<br/>

  Cor. So young, my lord, and true.<br/>

  Lear. Let it be so! thy truth then be thy dower!<br/>

     For, by the sacred radiance of the sun,<br/>

     The mysteries of Hecate and the night;<br/>

     By all the operation of the orbs<br/>

     From whom we do exist and cease to be;<br/>

     Here I disclaim all my paternal care,<br/>

     Propinquity and property of blood,<br/>

     And as a stranger to my heart and me<br/>

     Hold thee from this for ever. The barbarous Scythian,<br/>

     Or he that makes his generation messes<br/>

     To gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom<br/>

     Be as well neighbour'd, pitied, and reliev'd,<br/>

     As thou my sometime daughter.<br/>

  Kent. Good my liege-<br/>

  Lear. Peace, Kent!<br/>

     Come not between the dragon and his wrath.<br/>

     I lov'd her most, and thought to set my rest<br/>

     On her kind nursery.- Hence and avoid my sight!-<br/>

     So be my grave my peace as here I give<br/>

     Her father's heart from her! Call France! Who stirs?<br/>

     Call Burgundy! Cornwall and Albany,<br/>

     With my two daughters' dowers digest this third;<br/>

     Let pride, which she calls plainness, marry her.<br/>

     I do invest you jointly in my power,<br/>

     Preeminence, and all the large effects<br/>

     That troop with majesty. Ourself, by monthly course,<br/>

     With reservation of an hundred knights,<br/>

     By you to be sustain'd, shall our abode<br/>

     Make with you by due turns. Only we still retain<br/>

     The name, and all th' additions to a king. The sway,<br/>

     Revenue, execution of the rest,<br/>

     Beloved sons, be yours; which to confirm,<br/>

     This coronet part betwixt you.<br/>

  Kent. Royal Lear,<br/>

     Whom I have ever honour'd as my king,<br/>

     Lov'd as my father, as my master follow'd,<br/>

     As my great patron thought on in my prayers-<br/>

  Lear. The bow is bent and drawn; make from the shaft.<br/>

  Kent. Let it fall rather, though the fork invade<br/>

     The region of my heart! Be Kent unmannerly<br/>

     When Lear is mad. What wouldst thou do, old man?<br/>

     Think'st thou that duty shall have dread to speak<br/>

     When power to flattery bows? To plainness honour's bound<br/>

     When majesty falls to folly. Reverse thy doom;<br/>

     And in thy best consideration check<br/>

     This hideous rashness. Answer my life my judgment,<br/>

     Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least,<br/>

     Nor are those empty-hearted whose low sound<br/>

     Reverbs no hollowness.<br/>

  Lear. Kent, on thy life, no more!<br/>

  Kent. My life I never held but as a pawn<br/>

     To wage against thine enemies; nor fear to lose it,<br/>

     Thy safety being the motive.<br/>

  Lear. Out of my sight!<br/>

  Kent. See better, Lear, and let me still remain<br/>

     The true blank of thine eye.<br/>

  Lear. Now by Apollo-<br/>

  Kent. Now by Apollo, King,<br/>

     Thou swear'st thy gods in vain.<br/>

  Lear. O vassal! miscreant!<br/>

                                   [Lays his hand on his sword.]<br/>

  Alb., Corn. Dear sir, forbear!<br/>

  Kent. Do!<br/>

     Kill thy physician, and the fee bestow<br/>

     Upon the foul disease. Revoke thy gift,<br/>

     Or, whilst I can vent clamour from my throat,<br/>

     I'll tell thee thou dost evil.<br/>

  Lear. Hear me, recreant!<br/>

     On thine allegiance, hear me!<br/>

     Since thou hast sought to make us break our vow-<br/>

     Which we durst never yet- and with strain'd pride<br/>

     To come between our sentence and our power,-<br/>

     Which nor our nature nor our place can bear,-<br/>

     Our potency made good, take thy reward.<br/>

     Five days we do allot thee for provision<br/>

     To shield thee from diseases of the world,<br/>

     And on the sixth to turn thy hated back<br/>

     Upon our kingdom. If, on the tenth day following,<br/>

     Thy banish'd trunk be found in our dominions,<br/>

     The moment is thy death. Away! By Jupiter,<br/>

     This shall not be revok'd.<br/>

  Kent. Fare thee well, King. Since thus thou wilt appear,<br/>

     Freedom lives hence, and banishment is here.<br/>

     [To Cordelia] The gods to their dear shelter take thee,<br/>

maid,<br/>

     That justly think'st and hast most rightly said!<br/>

     [To Regan and Goneril] And your large speeches may your<br/>

deeds<br/>

        approve,<br/>

     That good effects may spring from words of love.<br/>

     Thus Kent, O princes, bids you all adieu;<br/>

     He'll shape his old course in a country new.<br/>

Exit.<br/>

<p id="id00056">  Glou. Here's France and Burgundy, my noble lord.<br/>

  Lear. My Lord of Burgundy,<br/>

     We first address toward you, who with this king<br/>

     Will you require in present dower with her,<br/>

     Or cease your quest of love?<br/>

  Bur. Most royal Majesty,<br/>

     I crave no more than hath your Highness offer'd,<br/>

     Nor will you tender less.<br/>

  Lear. Right noble Burgundy,<br/>

     When she was dear to us, we did hold her so;<br/>

     But now her price is fall'n. Sir, there she stands.<br/>

     If aught within that little seeming substance,<br/>

     Or all of it, with our displeasure piec'd,<br/>

     And nothing more, may fitly like your Grace,<br/>

     She's there, and she is yours.<br/>

  Bur. I know no answer.<br/>

  Lear. Will you, with those infirmities she owes,<br/>

     Unfriended, new adopted to our hate,<br/>

     Dow'r'd with our curse, and stranger'd with our oath,<br/>

     Take her, or leave her?<br/>

  Bur. Pardon me, royal sir.<br/>

     Election makes not up on such conditions.<br/>

  Lear. Then leave her, sir; for, by the pow'r that made me,<br/>

     I tell you all her wealth. [To France] For you, great King,<br/>

     I would not from your love make such a stray<br/>

     To match you where I hate; therefore beseech you<br/>

     T' avert your liking a more worthier way<br/>

     Than on a wretch whom nature is asham'd<br/>

     Almost t' acknowledge hers.<br/>

  France. This is most strange,<br/>

     That she that even but now was your best object,<br/>

     The argument of your praise, balm of your age,<br/>

     Most best, most dearest, should in this trice of time<br/>

     Commit a thing so monstrous to dismantle<br/>

     So many folds of favour. Sure her offence<br/>

     Must be of such unnatural degree<br/>

     That monsters it, or your fore-vouch'd affection<br/>

     Fall'n into taint; which to believe of her<br/>

     Must be a faith that reason without miracle<br/>

     Should never plant in me.<br/>

  Cor. I yet beseech your Majesty,<br/>

     If for I want that glib and oily art<br/>

     To speak and purpose not, since what I well intend,<br/>

     I'll do't before I speak- that you make known<br/>

     It is no vicious blot, murther, or foulness,<br/>

     No unchaste action or dishonoured step,<br/>

     That hath depriv'd me of your grace and favour;<br/>

     But even for want of that for which I am richer-<br/>

     A still-soliciting eye, and such a tongue<br/>

     As I am glad I have not, though not to have it<br/>

     Hath lost me in your liking.<br/>

  Lear. Better thou<br/>

     Hadst not been born than not t' have pleas'd me better.<br/>

  France. Is it but this- a tardiness in nature<br/>

     Which often leaves the history unspoke<br/>

     That it intends to do? My Lord of Burgundy,<br/>

     What say you to the lady? Love's not love<br/>

     When it is mingled with regards that stands<br/>

     Aloof from th' entire point. Will you have her?<br/>

     She is herself a dowry.<br/>

  Bur. Royal Lear,<br/>

     Give but that portion which yourself propos'd,<br/>

     And here I take Cordelia by the hand,<br/>

     Duchess of Burgundy.<br/>

  Lear. Nothing! I have sworn; I am firm.<br/>

  Bur. I am sorry then you have so lost a father<br/>

     That you must lose a husband.<br/>

  Cor. Peace be with Burgundy!<br/>

     Since that respects of fortune are his love,<br/>

     I shall not be his wife.<br/>

  France. Fairest Cordelia, that art most rich, being poor;<br/>

     Most choice, forsaken; and most lov'd, despis'd!<br/>

     Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon.<br/>

     Be it lawful I take up what's cast away.<br/>

     Gods, gods! 'tis strange that from their cold'st neglect<br/>

     My love should kindle to inflam'd respect.<br/>

     Thy dow'rless daughter, King, thrown to my chance,<br/>

     Is queen of us, of ours, and our fair France.<br/>

     Not all the dukes in wat'rish Burgundy<br/>

     Can buy this unpriz'd precious maid of me.<br/>

     Bid them farewell, Cordelia, though unkind.<br/>

     Thou losest here, a better where to find.<br/>

  Lear. Thou hast her, France; let her be thine; for we<br/>

     Have no such daughter, nor shall ever see<br/>

     That face of hers again. Therefore be gone<br/>

     Without our grace, our love, our benison.<br/>

     Come, noble Burgundy.<br/>

             Flourish. Exeunt Lear, Burgundy, [Cornwall, Albany,<br/>

                                    Gloucester, and Attendants].<br/>

  France. Bid farewell to your sisters.<br/>

  Cor. The jewels of our father, with wash'd eyes<br/>

     Cordelia leaves you. I know you what you are;<br/>

     And, like a sister, am most loath to call<br/>

     Your faults as they are nam'd. Use well our father.<br/>

     To your professed bosoms I commit him;<br/>

     But yet, alas, stood I within his grace,<br/>

     I would prefer him to a better place!<br/>

     So farewell to you both.<br/>

  Gon. Prescribe not us our duties.<br/>

  Reg. Let your study<br/>

     Be to content your lord, who hath receiv'd you<br/>

     At fortune's alms. You have obedience scanted,<br/>

     And well are worth the want that you have wanted.<br/>

  Cor. Time shall unfold what plighted cunning hides.<br/>

     Who cover faults, at last shame them derides.<br/>

     Well may you prosper!<br/>

  France. Come, my fair Cordelia.<br/>

                                     Exeunt France and Cordelia.<br/>

  Gon. Sister, it is not little I have to say of what most nearly<br/>

     appertains to us both. I think our father will hence<br/>

to-night.<br/>

  Reg. That's most certain, and with you; next month with us.<br/>

  Gon. You see how full of changes his age is. The observation we<br/>

     have made of it hath not been little. He always lov'd our<br/>

     sister most, and with what poor judgment he hath now cast<br/>

her<br/>

     off appears too grossly.<br/>

  Reg. 'Tis the infirmity of his age; yet he hath ever but<br/>

slenderly<br/>

     known himself.<br/>

  Gon. The best and soundest of his time hath been but rash; then<br/>

     must we look to receive from his age, not alone the<br/>

     imperfections of long-ingraffed condition, but therewithal<br/>

     the unruly waywardness that infirm and choleric years bring<br/>

with<br/>

     them.<br/>

  Reg. Such unconstant starts are we like to have from him as<br/>

this<br/>

     of Kent's banishment.<br/>

  Gon. There is further compliment of leave-taking between France<br/>

and<br/>

     him. Pray you let's hit together. If our father carry<br/>

authority<br/>

     with such dispositions as he bears, this last surrender of<br/>

his<br/>

     will but offend us.<br/>

  Reg. We shall further think on't.<br/>

  Gon. We must do something, and i' th' heat.<br/>

                                                         Exeunt.<br/>

</p>

<p id="id00063" style="margin-right: 6%; margin-left: 6%">     Hum! Conspiracy? 'Sleep till I wak'd him, you should enjoy
half
     his revenue.' My son Edgar! Had he a hand to write this? a
heart
     and brain to breed it in? When came this to you? Who brought
it?
  Edm. It was not brought me, my lord: there's the cunning of it.
I
     found it thrown in at the casement of my closet.
  Glou. You know the character to be your brother's?
  Edm. If the matter were good, my lord, I durst swear it were
his;
     but in respect of that, I would fain think it were not.
  Glou. It is his.
  Edm. It is his hand, my lord; but I hope his heart is not in
the
     contents.
  Glou. Hath he never before sounded you in this business?
  Edm. Never, my lord. But I have heard him oft maintain it to be
fit
     that, sons at perfect age, and fathers declining, the father
     should be as ward to the son, and the son manage his
revenue.
  Glou. O villain, villain! His very opinion in the letter!
Abhorred
     villain! Unnatural, detested, brutish villain! worse than
     brutish! Go, sirrah, seek him. I'll apprehend him.
Abominable
     villain! Where is he?
  Edm. I do not well know, my lord. If it shall please you to
suspend
     your indignation against my brother till you can derive from
him
     better testimony of his intent, you should run a certain
course;
     where, if you violently proceed against him, mistaking his
     purpose, it would make a great gap in your own honour and
shake
     in pieces the heart of his obedience. I dare pawn down my
life
     for him that he hath writ this to feel my affection to your
     honour, and to no other pretence of danger.
  Glou. Think you so?
  Edm. If your honour judge it meet, I will place you where you
shall
     hear us confer of this and by an auricular assurance have
your
     satisfaction, and that without any further delay than this
very
     evening.
  Glou. He cannot be such a monster.
  Edm. Nor is not, sure.
  Glou. To his father, that so tenderly and entirely loves him.
     Heaven and earth! Edmund, seek him out; wind me into him, I
pray
     you; frame the business after your own wisdom. I would
unstate
     myself to be in a due resolution.
  Edm. I will seek him, sir, presently; convey the business as I
     shall find means, and acquaint you withal.
  Glou. These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good
to
     us. Though the wisdom of nature can reason it thus and thus,
yet
     nature finds itself scourg'd by the sequent effects. Love
cools,
     friendship falls off, brothers divide. In cities, mutinies;
in
     countries, discord; in palaces, treason; and the bond
crack'd
     'twixt son and father. This villain of mine comes under the
     prediction; there's son against father: the King falls from
bias
     of nature; there's father against child. We have seen the
best
     of our time. Machinations, hollowness, treachery, and all
     ruinous disorders follow us disquietly to our graves. Find
out
     this villain, Edmund; it shall lose thee nothing; do it
     carefully. And the noble and true-hearted Kent banish'd! his
     offence, honesty! 'Tis strange.                       Exit.
  Edm. This is the excellent foppery of the world, that, when we
are
     sick in fortune, often the surfeit of our own behaviour, we
make
     guilty of our disasters the sun, the moon, and the stars; as
if
     we were villains on necessity; fools by heavenly compulsion;
     knaves, thieves, and treachers by spherical pre-dominance;
     drunkards, liars, and adulterers by an enforc'd obedience of
     planetary influence; and all that we are evil in, by a
divine
     thrusting on. An admirable evasion of whore-master man, to
lay
     his goatish disposition to the charge of a star! My father
     compounded with my mother under the Dragon's Tail, and my
     nativity was under Ursa Major, so that it follows I am rough
and
     lecherous. Fut! I should have been that I am, had the
     maidenliest star in the firmament twinkled on my
bastardizing.

<p id="id00065">     and pat! he comes, like the catastrophe of the old comedy.<br/>

Bedlam.<br/>

     O, these eclipses do portend these divisions! Fa, sol, la,<br/>

mi.<br/>

  Edg. How now, brother Edmund? What serious contemplation are<br/>

you<br/>

     in?<br/>

  Edm. I am thinking, brother, of a prediction I read this other<br/>

day,<br/>

     what should follow these eclipses.<br/>

  Edg. Do you busy yourself with that?<br/>

  Edm. I promise you, the effects he writes of succeed unhappily:<br/>

as<br/>

     of unnaturalness between the child and the parent; death,<br/>

     dearth, dissolutions of ancient amities; divisions in state,<br/>

     menaces and maledictions against king and nobles; needless<br/>

     diffidences, banishment of friends, dissipation of cohorts,<br/>

     nuptial breaches, and I know not what.<br/>

  Edg. How long have you been a sectary astronomical?<br/>

  Edm. Come, come! When saw you my father last?<br/>

  Edg. The night gone by.<br/>

  Edm. Spake you with him?<br/>

  Edg. Ay, two hours together.<br/>

  Edm. Parted you in good terms? Found you no displeasure in him<br/>

by<br/>

     word or countenance<br/>

  Edg. None at all.<br/>

  Edm. Bethink yourself wherein you may have offended him; and at<br/>

my<br/>

     entreaty forbear his presence until some little time hath<br/>

     qualified the heat of his displeasure, which at this instant<br/>

so<br/>

     rageth in him that with the mischief of your person it would<br/>

     scarcely allay.<br/>

  Edg. Some villain hath done me wrong.<br/>

  Edm. That's my fear. I pray you have a continent forbearance<br/>

till<br/>

     the speed of his rage goes slower; and, as I say, retire<br/>

with me<br/>

     to my lodging, from whence I will fitly bring you to hear my<br/>

     lord speak. Pray ye, go! There's my key. If you do stir<br/>

abroad,<br/>

     go arm'd.<br/>

  Edg. Arm'd, brother?<br/>

  Edm. Brother, I advise you to the best. Go arm'd. I am no<br/>

honest man<br/>

     if there be any good meaning toward you. I have told you<br/>

what I<br/>

     have seen and heard; but faintly, nothing like the image and<br/>

     horror of it. Pray you, away!<br/>

  Edg. Shall I hear from you anon?<br/>

  Edm. I do serve you in this business.<br/>

                                                     Exit Edgar.<br/>

     A credulous father! and a brother noble,<br/>

     Whose nature is so far from doing harms<br/>

     That he suspects none; on whose foolish honesty<br/>

     My practices ride easy! I see the business.<br/>

  Lear. Do you bandy looks with me, you rascal?<br/>

                                                  [Strikes him.]<br/>

  Osw. I'll not be strucken, my lord.<br/>

  Kent. Nor tripp'd neither, you base football player?<br/>

                                            [Trips up his heels.<br/>

  Lear. I thank thee, fellow. Thou serv'st me, and I'll love<br/>

thee.<br/>

  Kent. Come, sir, arise, away! I'll teach you differences. Away,<br/>

     away! If you will measure your lubber's length again, tarry;<br/>

but<br/>

     away! Go to! Have you wisdom? So.<br/>

                                               [Pushes him out.]<br/>

  Lear. Now, my friendly knave, I thank thee. There's earnest of<br/>

thy<br/>

     service.                                     [Gives money.]<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00081">                             Enter Fool.</p>

<p id="id00082">  Fool. Let me hire him too. Here's my coxcomb.<br/>

                                          [Offers Kent his cap.]<br/>

  Lear. How now, my pretty knave? How dost thou?<br/>

  Fool. Sirrah, you were best take my coxcomb.<br/>

  Kent. Why, fool?<br/>

  Fool. Why? For taking one's part that's out of favour. Nay, an<br/>

thou<br/>

     canst not smile as the wind sits, thou'lt catch cold<br/>

shortly.<br/>

     There, take my coxcomb! Why, this fellow hath banish'd two<br/>

on's<br/>

     daughters, and did the third a blessing against his will. If<br/>

     thou follow him, thou must needs wear my coxcomb.- How now,<br/>

     nuncle? Would I had two coxcombs and two daughters!<br/>

  Lear. Why, my boy?<br/>

  Fool. If I gave them all my living, I'ld keep my coxcombs<br/>

myself.<br/>

     There's mine! beg another of thy daughters.<br/>

  Lear. Take heed, sirrah- the whip.<br/>

  Fool. Truth's a dog must to kennel; he must be whipp'd out,<br/>

when<br/>

     Lady the brach may stand by th' fire and stink.<br/>

  Lear. A pestilent gall to me!<br/>

  Fool. Sirrah, I'll teach thee a speech.<br/>

  Lear. Do.<br/>

  Fool. Mark it, nuncle.<br/>

          Have more than thou showest,<br/>

          Speak less than thou knowest,<br/>

          Lend less than thou owest,<br/>

          Ride more than thou goest,<br/>

          Learn more than thou trowest,<br/>

          Set less than thou throwest;<br/>

          Leave thy drink and thy whore,<br/>

          And keep in-a-door,<br/>

          And thou shalt have more<br/>

          Than two tens to a score.<br/>

  Kent. This is nothing, fool.<br/>

  Fool. Then 'tis like the breath of an unfeed lawyer- you gave<br/>

me<br/>

     nothing for't. Can you make no use of nothing, nuncle?<br/>

  Lear. Why, no, boy. Nothing can be made out of nothing.<br/>

  Fool. [to Kent] Prithee tell him, so much the rent of his land<br/>

     comes to. He will not believe a fool.<br/>

  Lear. A bitter fool!<br/>

  Fool. Dost thou know the difference, my boy, between a bitter<br/>

     fool and a sweet fool?<br/>

  Lear. No, lad; teach me.<br/>

  Fool.   That lord that counsell'd thee<br/>

            To give away thy land,<br/>

          Come place him here by me-<br/>

            Do thou for him stand.<br/>

          The sweet and bitter fool<br/>

            Will presently appear;<br/>

          The one in motley here,<br/>

            The other found out there.<br/>

  Lear. Dost thou call me fool, boy?<br/>

  Fool. All thy other titles thou hast given away; that thou wast<br/>

     born with.<br/>

  Kent. This is not altogether fool, my lord.<br/>

  Fool. No, faith; lords and great men will not let me. If I had<br/>

a<br/>

     monopoly out, they would have part on't. And ladies too,<br/>

they<br/>

     will not let me have all the fool to myself; they'll be<br/>

     snatching. Give me an egg, nuncle, and I'll give thee two<br/>

     crowns.<br/>

  Lear. What two crowns shall they be?<br/>

  Fool. Why, after I have cut the egg i' th' middle and eat up<br/>

the<br/>

     meat, the two crowns of the egg. When thou clovest thy crown<br/>

i'<br/>

     th' middle and gav'st away both parts, thou bor'st thine ass<br/>

on<br/>

     thy back o'er the dirt. Thou hadst little wit in thy bald<br/>

crown<br/>

     when thou gav'st thy golden one away. If I speak like myself<br/>

in<br/>

     this, let him be whipp'd that first finds it so.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00083">     [Sings]    Fools had ne'er less grace in a year,<br/>

                  For wise men are grown foppish;<br/>

                They know not how their wits to wear,<br/>

                  Their manners are so apish.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00084">  Lear. When were you wont to be so full of songs, sirrah?<br/>

  Fool. I have us'd it, nuncle, ever since thou mad'st thy<br/>

daughters<br/>

     thy mother; for when thou gav'st them the rod, and put'st<br/>

down<br/>

     thine own breeches,<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00085">     [Sings]    Then they for sudden joy did weep,<br/>

                  And I for sorrow sung,<br/>

                That such a king should play bo-peep<br/>

                  And go the fools among.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00086">     Prithee, nuncle, keep a schoolmaster that can teach thy fool<br/>

to<br/>

     lie. I would fain learn to lie.<br/>

  Lear. An you lie, sirrah, we'll have you whipp'd.<br/>

  Fool. I marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are. They'll<br/>

have me<br/>

     whipp'd for speaking true; thou'lt have me whipp'd for<br/>

lying;<br/>

     and sometimes I am whipp'd for holding my peace. I had<br/>

rather be<br/>

     any kind o' thing than a fool! And yet I would not be thee,<br/>

     nuncle. Thou hast pared thy wit o' both sides and left<br/>

nothing<br/>

     i' th' middle. Here comes one o' the parings.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00087">                            Enter Goneril.</p>

<p id="id00088">  Lear. How now, daughter? What makes that frontlet on? Methinks<br/>

you<br/>

     are too much o' late i' th' frown.<br/>

  Fool. Thou wast a pretty fellow when thou hadst no need to care<br/>

for<br/>

     her frowning. Now thou art an O without a figure. I am<br/>

better<br/>

     than thou art now: I am a fool, thou art nothing.<br/>

     [To Goneril] Yes, forsooth, I will hold my tongue. So your<br/>

face<br/>

     bids me, though you say nothing. Mum, mum!<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00089">            He that keeps nor crust nor crum,<br/>

            Weary of all, shall want some.-<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00090">     [Points at Lear] That's a sheal'd peascod.<br/>

  Gon. Not only, sir, this your all-licens'd fool,<br/>

     But other of your insolent retinue<br/>

     Do hourly carp and quarrel, breaking forth<br/>

     In rank and not-to-be-endured riots. Sir,<br/>

     I had thought, by making this well known unto you,<br/>

     To have found a safe redress, but now grow fearful,<br/>

     By what yourself, too, late have spoke and done,<br/>

     That you protect this course, and put it on<br/>

     By your allowance; which if you should, the fault<br/>

     Would not scape censure, nor the redresses sleep,<br/>

     Which, in the tender of a wholesome weal,<br/>

     Might in their working do you that offence<br/>

     Which else were shame, that then necessity<br/>

     Must call discreet proceeding.<br/>

  Fool. For you know, nuncle,<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00091">          The hedge-sparrow fed the cuckoo so long<br/>

          That it had it head bit off by it young.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00092">     So out went the candle, and we were left darkling.<br/>

  Lear. Are you our daughter?<br/>

  Gon. Come, sir,<br/>

     I would you would make use of that good wisdom<br/>

     Whereof I know you are fraught, and put away<br/>

     These dispositions that of late transform you<br/>

     From what you rightly are.<br/>

  Fool. May not an ass know when the cart draws the horse?<br/>

     Whoop, Jug, I love thee!<br/>

  Lear. Doth any here know me? This is not Lear.<br/>

     Doth Lear walk thus? speak thus? Where are his eyes?<br/>

     Either his notion weakens, his discernings<br/>

     Are lethargied- Ha! waking? 'Tis not so!<br/>

     Who is it that can tell me who I am?<br/>

  Fool. Lear's shadow.<br/>

  Lear. I would learn that; for, by the marks of sovereignty,<br/>

     Knowledge, and reason, I should be false persuaded<br/>

     I had daughters.<br/>

  Fool. Which they will make an obedient father.<br/>

  Lear. Your name, fair gentlewoman?<br/>

  Gon. This admiration, sir, is much o' th' savour<br/>

     Of other your new pranks. I do beseech you<br/>

     To understand my purposes aright.<br/>

     As you are old and reverend, you should be wise.<br/>

     Here do you keep a hundred knights and squires;<br/>

     Men so disorder'd, so debosh'd, and bold<br/>

     That this our court, infected with their manners,<br/>

     Shows like a riotous inn. Epicurism and lust<br/>

     Make it more like a tavern or a brothel<br/>

     Than a grac'd palace. The shame itself doth speak<br/>

     For instant remedy. Be then desir'd<br/>

     By her that else will take the thing she begs<br/>

     A little to disquantity your train,<br/>

     And the remainder that shall still depend<br/>

     To be such men as may besort your age,<br/>

     Which know themselves, and you.<br/>

  Lear. Darkness and devils!<br/>

     Saddle my horses! Call my train together!<br/>

     Degenerate bastard, I'll not trouble thee;<br/>

     Yet have I left a daughter.<br/>

  Gon. You strike my people, and your disorder'd rabble<br/>

     Make servants of their betters.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00093">                            Enter Albany.</p>

<p id="id00094">  Lear. Woe that too late repents!- O, sir, are you come?<br/>

     Is it your will? Speak, sir!- Prepare my horses.<br/>

     Ingratitude, thou marble-hearted fiend,<br/>

     More hideous when thou show'st thee in a child<br/>

     Than the sea-monster!<br/>

  Alb. Pray, sir, be patient.<br/>

  Lear. [to Goneril] Detested kite, thou liest!<br/>

     My train are men of choice and rarest parts,<br/>

     That all particulars of duty know<br/>

     And in the most exact regard support<br/>

     The worships of their name.- O most small fault,<br/>

     How ugly didst thou in Cordelia show!<br/>

     Which, like an engine, wrench'd my frame of nature<br/>

     From the fix'd place; drew from my heart all love<br/>

     And added to the gall. O Lear, Lear, Lear!<br/>

     Beat at this gate that let thy folly in  [Strikes his head.]<br/>

     And thy dear judgment out! Go, go, my people.<br/>

  Alb. My lord, I am guiltless, as I am ignorant<br/>

     Of what hath mov'd you.<br/>

  Lear. It may be so, my lord.<br/>

     Hear, Nature, hear! dear goddess, hear!<br/>

     Suspend thy purpose, if thou didst intend<br/>

     To make this creature fruitful.<br/>

     Into her womb convey sterility;<br/>

     Dry up in her the organs of increase;<br/>

     And from her derogate body never spring<br/>

     A babe to honour her! If she must teem,<br/>

     Create her child of spleen, that it may live<br/>

     And be a thwart disnatur'd torment to her.<br/>

     Let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth,<br/>

     With cadent tears fret channels in her cheeks,<br/>

     Turn all her mother's pains and benefits<br/>

     To laughter and contempt, that she may feel<br/>

     How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is<br/>

     To have a thankless child! Away, away!                Exit.<br/>

  Alb. Now, gods that we adore, whereof comes this?<br/>

  Gon. Never afflict yourself to know the cause;<br/>

     But let his disposition have that scope<br/>

     That dotage gives it.<br/>
