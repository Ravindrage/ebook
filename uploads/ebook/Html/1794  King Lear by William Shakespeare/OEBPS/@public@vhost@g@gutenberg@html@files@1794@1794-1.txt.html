  <body><p id="id00095">                             Enter Lear.</p>

<p id="id00096">  Lear. What, fifty of my followers at a clap?<br/>

     Within a fortnight?<br/>

  Alb. What's the matter, sir?<br/>

  Lear. I'll tell thee. [To Goneril] Life and death! I am asham'd<br/>

     That thou hast power to shake my manhood thus;<br/>

     That these hot tears, which break from me perforce,<br/>

     Should make thee worth them. Blasts and fogs upon thee!<br/>

     Th' untented woundings of a father's curse<br/>

     Pierce every sense about thee!- Old fond eyes,<br/>

     Beweep this cause again, I'll pluck ye out,<br/>

     And cast you, with the waters that you lose,<br/>

     To temper clay. Yea, is it come to this?<br/>

     Let it be so. Yet have I left a daughter,<br/>

     Who I am sure is kind and comfortable.<br/>

     When she shall hear this of thee, with her nails<br/>

     She'll flay thy wolvish visage. Thou shalt find<br/>

     That I'll resume the shape which thou dost think<br/>

     I have cast off for ever; thou shalt, I warrant thee.<br/>

                            Exeunt [Lear, Kent, and Attendants].<br/>

  Gon. Do you mark that, my lord?<br/>

  Alb. I cannot be so partial, Goneril,<br/>

     To the great love I bear you -<br/>

  Gon. Pray you, content.- What, Oswald, ho!<br/>

     [To the Fool] You, sir, more knave than fool, after your<br/>

master!<br/>

  Fool. Nuncle Lear, nuncle Lear, tarry! Take the fool with thee.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00097" style="margin-top: 2em">          A fox when one has caught her,<br/>

          And such a daughter,<br/>

          Should sure to the slaughter,<br/>

          If my cap would buy a halter.<br/>

          So the fool follows after.                       Exit.<br/>

  Gon. This man hath had good counsel! A hundred knights?<br/>

     'Tis politic and safe to let him keep<br/>

     At point a hundred knights; yes, that on every dream,<br/>

     Each buzz, each fancy, each complaint, dislike,<br/>

     He may enguard his dotage with their pow'rs<br/>

     And hold our lives in mercy.- Oswald, I say!<br/>

  Alb. Well, you may fear too far.<br/>

  Gon. Safer than trust too far.<br/>

     Let me still take away the harms I fear,<br/>

     Not fear still to be taken. I know his heart.<br/>

     What he hath utter'd I have writ my sister.<br/>

     If she sustain him and his hundred knights,<br/>

     When I have show'd th' unfitness-<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00098">                     Enter [Oswald the] Steward.</p>

<p id="id00099">     How now, Oswald?<br/>

     What, have you writ that letter to my sister?<br/>

  Osw. Yes, madam.<br/>

  Gon. Take you some company, and away to horse!<br/>

     Inform her full of my particular fear,<br/>

     And thereto add such reasons of your own<br/>

     As may compact it more. Get you gone,<br/>

     And hasten your return. [Exit Oswald.] No, no, my lord!<br/>

     This milky gentleness and course of yours,<br/>

     Though I condemn it not, yet, under pardon,<br/>

     You are much more at task for want of wisdom<br/>

     Than prais'd for harmful mildness.<br/>

  Alb. How far your eyes may pierce I cannot tell.<br/>

     Striving to better, oft we mar what's well.<br/>

  Gon. Nay then-<br/>

  Alb. Well, well; th' event.                            Exeunt.<br/>

Court before the Duke of Albany's Palace.</h2>

<p id="id00101">Enter Lear, Kent, and Fool.</p>

<p id="id00102">  Lear. Go you before to Gloucester with these letters. Acquaint<br/>

my<br/>

     daughter no further with anything you know than comes from<br/>

her<br/>

     demand out of the letter. If your diligence be not speedy, I<br/>

     shall be there afore you.<br/>

  Kent. I will not sleep, my lord, till I have delivered your<br/>

letter.<br/>

Exit.<br/>

  Fool. If a man's brains were in's heels, were't not in danger<br/>

of<br/>

     kibes?<br/>

  Lear. Ay, boy.<br/>

  Fool. Then I prithee be merry. Thy wit shall ne'er go<br/>

slip-shod.<br/>

  Lear. Ha, ha, ha!<br/>

  Fool. Shalt see thy other daughter will use thee kindly; for<br/>

though<br/>

     she's as like this as a crab's like an apple, yet I can tell<br/>

     what I can tell.<br/>

  Lear. What canst tell, boy?<br/>

  Fool. She'll taste as like this as a crab does to a crab. Thou<br/>

     canst tell why one's nose stands i' th' middle on's face?<br/>

  Lear. No.<br/>

  Fool. Why, to keep one's eyes of either side's nose, that what<br/>

a<br/>

     man cannot smell out, 'a may spy into.<br/>

  Lear. I did her wrong.<br/>

  Fool. Canst tell how an oyster makes his shell?<br/>

  Lear. No.<br/>

  Fool. Nor I neither; but I can tell why a snail has a house.<br/>

  Lear. Why?<br/>

  Fool. Why, to put's head in; not to give it away to his<br/>

daughters,<br/>

     and leave his horns without a case.<br/>

  Lear. I will forget my nature. So kind a father!- Be my horses<br/>

     ready?<br/>

  Fool. Thy asses are gone about 'em. The reason why the seven<br/>

stars<br/>

     are no moe than seven is a pretty reason.<br/>

  Lear. Because they are not eight?<br/>

  Fool. Yes indeed. Thou wouldst make a good fool.<br/>

  Lear. To tak't again perforce! Monster ingratitude!<br/>

  Fool. If thou wert my fool, nuncle, I'ld have thee beaten for<br/>

being<br/>

     old before thy time.<br/>

  Lear. How's that?<br/>

  Fool. Thou shouldst not have been old till thou hadst been<br/>

wise.<br/>

  Lear. O, let me not be mad, not mad, sweet heaven!<br/>

     Keep me in temper; I would not be mad!<br/>

  Gent. Ready, my lord.<br/>

  Lear. Come, boy.<br/>

<h3 id="id00106" style="margin-top: 3em">ACT II. Scene I.
A court within the Castle of the Earl of Gloucester.</h3>

<p id="id00107">Enter [Edmund the] Bastard and Curan, meeting.</p>

<p id="id00108">  Edm. Save thee, Curan.<br/>

  Cur. And you, sir. I have been with your father, and given him<br/>

     notice that the Duke of Cornwall and Regan his Duchess will<br/>

be<br/>

     here with him this night.<br/>

  Edm. How comes that?<br/>

  Cur. Nay, I know not. You have heard of the news abroad- I mean<br/>

the<br/>

     whisper'd ones, for they are yet but ear-kissing arguments?<br/>

  Edm. Not I. Pray you, what are they?<br/>

  Cur. Have you heard of no likely wars toward 'twixt the two<br/>

Dukes<br/>

     of Cornwall and Albany?<br/>

  Edm. Not a word.<br/>

  Cur. You may do, then, in time. Fare you well, sir.      Exit.<br/>

  Edm. The Duke be here to-night? The better! best!<br/>

     This weaves itself perforce into my business.<br/>

     My father hath set guard to take my brother;<br/>

     And I have one thing, of a queasy question,<br/>

     Which I must act. Briefness and fortune, work!<br/>

     Brother, a word! Descend! Brother, I say!<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00109">                             Enter Edgar.</p>

<p id="id00110">     My father watches. O sir, fly this place!<br/>

     Intelligence is given where you are hid.<br/>

     You have now the good advantage of the night.<br/>

     Have you not spoken 'gainst the Duke of Cornwall?<br/>

     He's coming hither; now, i' th' night, i' th' haste,<br/>

     And Regan with him. Have you nothing said<br/>

     Upon his party 'gainst the Duke of Albany?<br/>

     Advise yourself.<br/>

  Edg. I am sure on't, not a word.<br/>

  Edm. I hear my father coming. Pardon me!<br/>

     In cunning I must draw my sword upon you.<br/>

     Draw, seem to defend yourself; now quit you well.-<br/>

     Yield! Come before my father. Light, ho, here!<br/>

     Fly, brother.- Torches, torches!- So farewell.<br/>

                                                     Exit Edgar.<br/>

     Some blood drawn on me would beget opinion<br/>

     Of my more fierce endeavour. [Stabs his arm.] I have seen<br/>

        drunkards<br/>

     Do more than this in sport.- Father, father!-<br/>

     Stop, stop! No help?<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00111">             Enter Gloucester, and Servants with torches.</p>

<p id="id00112">  Glou. Now, Edmund, where's the villain?<br/>

  Edm. Here stood he in the dark, his sharp sword out,<br/>

     Mumbling of wicked charms, conjuring the moon<br/>

     To stand 's auspicious mistress.<br/>

  Glou. But where is he?<br/>

  Edm. Look, sir, I bleed.<br/>

  Glou. Where is the villain, Edmund?<br/>

  Edm. Fled this way, sir. When by no means he could-<br/>

  Glou. Pursue him, ho! Go after.        [Exeunt some Servants].<br/>

     By no means what?<br/>

  Edm. Persuade me to the murther of your lordship;<br/>

     But that I told him the revenging gods<br/>

     'Gainst parricides did all their thunders bend;<br/>

     Spoke with how manifold and strong a bond<br/>

     The child was bound to th' father- sir, in fine,<br/>

     Seeing how loathly opposite I stood<br/>

     To his unnatural purpose, in fell motion<br/>

     With his prepared sword he charges home<br/>

     My unprovided body, lanch'd mine arm;<br/>

     But when he saw my best alarum'd spirits,<br/>

     Bold in the quarrel's right, rous'd to th' encounter,<br/>

     Or whether gasted by the noise I made,<br/>

     Full suddenly he fled.<br/>

  Glou. Let him fly far.<br/>

     Not in this land shall he remain uncaught;<br/>

     And found- dispatch. The noble Duke my master,<br/>

     My worthy arch and patron, comes to-night.<br/>

     By his authority I will proclaim it<br/>

     That he which find, him shall deserve our thanks,<br/>

     Bringing the murderous caitiff to the stake;<br/>

     He that conceals him, death.<br/>

  Edm. When I dissuaded him from his intent<br/>

     And found him pight to do it, with curst speech<br/>

     I threaten'd to discover him. He replied,<br/>

     'Thou unpossessing bastard, dost thou think,<br/>

     If I would stand against thee, would the reposal<br/>

     Of any trust, virtue, or worth in thee<br/>

     Make thy words faith'd? No. What I should deny<br/>

     (As this I would; ay, though thou didst produce<br/>

     My very character), I'ld turn it all<br/>

     To thy suggestion, plot, and damned practice;<br/>

     And thou must make a dullard of the world,<br/>

     If they not thought the profits of my death<br/>

     Were very pregnant and potential spurs<br/>

     To make thee seek it.'<br/>

  Glou. Strong and fast'ned villain!<br/>

     Would he deny his letter? I never got him.<br/>

                                                  Tucket within.<br/>

     Hark, the Duke's trumpets! I know not why he comes.<br/>

     All ports I'll bar; the villain shall not scape;<br/>

     The Duke must grant me that. Besides, his picture<br/>

     I will send far and near, that all the kingdom<br/>

     May have due note of him, and of my land,<br/>

     Loyal and natural boy, I'll work the means<br/>

     To make thee capable.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00113">                Enter Cornwall, Regan, and Attendants.</p>

<p id="id00114">  Corn. How now, my noble friend? Since I came hither<br/>

     (Which I can call but now) I have heard strange news.<br/>

  Reg. If it be true, all vengeance comes too short<br/>

     Which can pursue th' offender. How dost, my lord?<br/>

  Glou. O madam, my old heart is crack'd, it's crack'd!<br/>

  Reg. What, did my father's godson seek your life?<br/>

     He whom my father nam'd? Your Edgar?<br/>

  Glou. O lady, lady, shame would have it hid!<br/>

  Reg. Was he not companion with the riotous knights<br/>

     That tend upon my father?<br/>

  Glou. I know not, madam. 'Tis too bad, too bad!<br/>

  Edm. Yes, madam, he was of that consort.<br/>

  Reg. No marvel then though he were ill affected.<br/>

     'Tis they have put him on the old man's death,<br/>

     To have th' expense and waste of his revenues.<br/>

     I have this present evening from my sister<br/>

     Been well inform'd of them, and with such cautions<br/>

     That, if they come to sojourn at my house,<br/>

     I'll not be there.<br/>

  Corn. Nor I, assure thee, Regan.<br/>

     Edmund, I hear that you have shown your father<br/>

     A childlike office.<br/>

  Edm. 'Twas my duty, sir.<br/>

  Glou. He did bewray his practice, and receiv'd<br/>

     This hurt you see, striving to apprehend him.<br/>

  Corn. Is he pursued?<br/>

  Glou. Ay, my good lord.<br/>

  Corn. If he be taken, he shall never more<br/>

     Be fear'd of doing harm. Make your own purpose,<br/>

     How in my strength you please. For you, Edmund,<br/>

     Whose virtue and obedience doth this instant<br/>

     So much commend itself, you shall be ours.<br/>

     Natures of such deep trust we shall much need;<br/>

     You we first seize on.<br/>

  Edm. I shall serve you, sir,<br/>

     Truly, however else.<br/>

  Glou. For him I thank your Grace.<br/>

  Corn. You know not why we came to visit you-<br/>

  Reg. Thus out of season, threading dark-ey'd night.<br/>

     Occasions, noble Gloucester, of some poise,<br/>

     Wherein we must have use of your advice.<br/>

     Our father he hath writ, so hath our sister,<br/>

     Of differences, which I best thought it fit<br/>

     To answer from our home. The several messengers<br/>

     From hence attend dispatch. Our good old friend,<br/>

     Lay comforts to your bosom, and bestow<br/>

     Your needful counsel to our business,<br/>

     Which craves the instant use.<br/>

  Glou. I serve you, madam.<br/>

     Your Graces are right welcome.<br/>

                                               Exeunt. Flourish.<br/>

<p id="id00116">Enter Kent and [Oswald the] Steward, severally.</p>

<p id="id00117">  Osw. Good dawning to thee, friend. Art of this house?<br/>

  Kent. Ay.<br/>

  Osw. Where may we set our horses?<br/>

  Kent. I' th' mire.<br/>

  Osw. Prithee, if thou lov'st me, tell me.<br/>

  Kent. I love thee not.<br/>

  Osw. Why then, I care not for thee.<br/>

  Kent. If I had thee in Lipsbury Pinfold, I would make thee care<br/>

for<br/>

     me.<br/>

  Osw. Why dost thou use me thus? I know thee not.<br/>

  Kent. Fellow, I know thee.<br/>

  Osw. What dost thou know me for?<br/>

  Kent. A knave; a rascal; an eater of broken meats; a base,<br/>

proud,<br/>

     shallow, beggarly, three-suited, hundred-pound, filthy,<br/>

     worsted-stocking knave; a lily-liver'd, action-taking,<br/>

whoreson,<br/>

     glass-gazing, superserviceable, finical rogue;<br/>

     one-trunk-inheriting slave; one that wouldst be a bawd in<br/>

the<br/>

     least syllable of thy addition.<br/>

  Osw. Why, what a monstrous fellow art thou, thus to rail on one<br/>

     that's neither known of thee nor knows thee!<br/>

  Kent. What a brazen-fac'd varlet art thou, to deny thou knowest<br/>

me!<br/>

     Is it two days ago since I beat thee and tripp'd up thy<br/>

heels<br/>

     before the King? [Draws his sword.] Draw, you rogue! for,<br/>

though<br/>

     it be night, yet the moon shines. I'll make a sop o' th'<br/>

     moonshine o' you. Draw, you whoreson cullionly barbermonger!<br/>

     draw!<br/>

  Osw. Away! I have nothing to do with thee.<br/>

  Kent. Draw, you rascal! You come with letters against the King,<br/>

and<br/>

     take Vanity the puppet's part against the royalty of her<br/>

father.<br/>

     Draw, you rogue, or I'll so carbonado your shanks! Draw, you<br/>

     rascal! Come your ways!<br/>

  Osw. Help, ho! murther! help!<br/>

  Kent. Strike, you slave! Stand, rogue! Stand, you neat slave!<br/>

     Strike!                                        [Beats him.]<br/>

  Kent. With you, goodman boy, an you please! Come, I'll flesh<br/>

ye!<br/>

     Come on, young master!<br/>

  Glou. Weapons? arms? What's the matter here?<br/>

  Corn. Keep peace, upon your lives!<br/>

     He dies that strikes again. What is the matter?<br/>

  Reg. The messengers from our sister and the King<br/>

  Corn. What is your difference? Speak.<br/>

  Osw. I am scarce in breath, my lord.<br/>

  Kent. No marvel, you have so bestirr'd your valour. You<br/>

cowardly<br/>

     rascal, nature disclaims in thee; a tailor made thee.<br/>

  Corn. Thou art a strange fellow. A tailor make a man?<br/>

  Kent. Ay, a tailor, sir. A stonecutter or a painter could not<br/>

have<br/>

     made him so ill, though he had been but two hours at the<br/>

trade.<br/>

  Corn. Speak yet, how grew your quarrel?<br/>

  Osw. This ancient ruffian, sir, whose life I have spar'd<br/>

     At suit of his grey beard-<br/>

  Kent. Thou whoreson zed! thou unnecessary letter! My lord, if<br/>

     you'll give me leave, I will tread this unbolted villain<br/>

into<br/>

     mortar and daub the walls of a jakes with him. 'Spare my<br/>

grey<br/>

     beard,' you wagtail?<br/>

  Corn. Peace, sirrah!<br/>

     You beastly knave, know you no reverence?<br/>

  Kent. Yes, sir, but anger hath a privilege.<br/>

  Corn. Why art thou angry?<br/>

  Kent. That such a slave as this should wear a sword,<br/>

     Who wears no honesty. Such smiling rogues as these,<br/>

     Like rats, oft bite the holy cords atwain<br/>

     Which are too intrinse t' unloose; smooth every passion<br/>

     That in the natures of their lords rebel,<br/>

     Bring oil to fire, snow to their colder moods;<br/>

     Renege, affirm, and turn their halcyon beaks<br/>

     With every gale and vary of their masters,<br/>

     Knowing naught (like dogs) but following.<br/>

     A plague upon your epileptic visage!<br/>

     Smile you my speeches, as I were a fool?<br/>

     Goose, an I had you upon Sarum Plain,<br/>

     I'ld drive ye cackling home to Camelot.<br/>

  Corn. What, art thou mad, old fellow?<br/>

  Glou. How fell you out? Say that.<br/>

  Kent. No contraries hold more antipathy<br/>

     Than I and such a knave.<br/>

  Corn. Why dost thou call him knave? What is his fault?<br/>

  Kent. His countenance likes me not.<br/>

  Corn. No more perchance does mine, or his, or hers.<br/>

  Kent. Sir, 'tis my occupation to be plain.<br/>

     I have seen better faces in my time<br/>

     Than stands on any shoulder that I see<br/>

     Before me at this instant.<br/>

  Corn. This is some fellow<br/>

     Who, having been prais'd for bluntness, doth affect<br/>

     A saucy roughness, and constrains the garb<br/>

     Quite from his nature. He cannot flatter, he!<br/>

     An honest mind and plain- he must speak truth!<br/>

     An they will take it, so; if not, he's plain.<br/>

     These kind of knaves I know which in this plainness<br/>

     Harbour more craft and more corrupter ends<br/>

     Than twenty silly-ducking observants<br/>

     That stretch their duties nicely.<br/>

  Kent. Sir, in good faith, in sincere verity,<br/>

     Under th' allowance of your great aspect,<br/>

     Whose influence, like the wreath of radiant fire<br/>

     On flickering Phoebus' front-<br/>

  Corn. What mean'st by this?<br/>

  Kent. To go out of my dialect, which you discommend so much. I<br/>

     know, sir, I am no flatterer. He that beguil'd you in a<br/>

plain<br/>

     accent was a plain knave, which, for my part, I will not be,<br/>

     though I should win your displeasure to entreat me to't.<br/>

  Corn. What was th' offence you gave him?<br/>

  Osw. I never gave him any.<br/>

     It pleas'd the King his master very late<br/>

     To strike at me, upon his misconstruction;<br/>

     When he, conjunct, and flattering his displeasure,<br/>

     Tripp'd me behind; being down, insulted, rail'd<br/>

     And put upon him such a deal of man<br/>

     That worthied him, got praises of the King<br/>

     For him attempting who was self-subdu'd;<br/>

     And, in the fleshment of this dread exploit,<br/>

     Drew on me here again.<br/>

  Kent. None of these rogues and cowards<br/>

     But Ajax is their fool.<br/>

  Corn. Fetch forth the stocks!<br/>

     You stubborn ancient knave, you reverent braggart,<br/>

     We'll teach you-<br/>

  Kent. Sir, I am too old to learn.<br/>

     Call not your stocks for me. I serve the King;<br/>

     On whose employment I was sent to you.<br/>

     You shall do small respect, show too bold malice<br/>

     Against the grace and person of my master,<br/>

     Stocking his messenger.<br/>

  Corn. Fetch forth the stocks! As I have life and honour,<br/>

     There shall he sit till noon.<br/>

  Reg. Till noon? Till night, my lord, and all night too!<br/>

  Kent. Why, madam, if I were your father's dog,<br/>

     You should not use me so.<br/>

  Reg. Sir, being his knave, I will.<br/>

  Corn. This is a fellow of the selfsame colour<br/>

     Our sister speaks of. Come, bring away the stocks!<br/>

                                             Stocks brought out.<br/>

  Glou. Let me beseech your Grace not to do so.<br/>

     His fault is much, and the good King his master<br/>

     Will check him for't. Your purpos'd low correction<br/>

     Is such as basest and contemn'dest wretches<br/>

     For pilf'rings and most common trespasses<br/>

     Are punish'd with. The King must take it ill<br/>

     That he, so slightly valued in his messenger,<br/>

     Should have him thus restrain'd.<br/>

  Corn. I'll answer that.<br/>

  Reg. My sister may receive it much more worse,<br/>

     To have her gentleman abus'd, assaulted,<br/>

     For following her affairs. Put in his legs.-<br/>

                                    [Kent is put in the stocks.]<br/>

     Come, my good lord, away.<br/>

                           Exeunt [all but Gloucester and Kent].<br/>

  Glou. I am sorry for thee, friend. 'Tis the Duke's pleasure,<br/>

     Whose disposition, all the world well knows,<br/>

     Will not be rubb'd nor stopp'd. I'll entreat for thee.<br/>

  Kent. Pray do not, sir. I have watch'd and travell'd hard.<br/>

     Some time I shall sleep out, the rest I'll whistle.<br/>

     A good man's fortune may grow out at heels.<br/>

     Give you good morrow!<br/>

  Glou. The Duke 's to blame in this; 'twill be ill taken.<br/>

Exit.<br/>

  Kent. Good King, that must approve the common saw,<br/>

     Thou out of heaven's benediction com'st<br/>

     To the warm sun!<br/>

     Approach, thou beacon to this under globe,<br/>

     That by thy comfortable beams I may<br/>

     Peruse this letter. Nothing almost sees miracles<br/>

     But misery. I know 'tis from Cordelia,<br/>

     Who hath most fortunately been inform'd<br/>

     Of my obscured course- and [reads] 'shall find time<br/>

     From this enormous state, seeking to give<br/>

     Losses their remedies'- All weary and o'erwatch'd,<br/>

     Take vantage, heavy eyes, not to behold<br/>

     This shameful lodging.<br/>

     Fortune, good night; smile once more, turn thy wheel.<br/>

                                                         Sleeps.<br/>

The open country.</h2>

<p id="id00121">Enter Edgar.</p>

<p id="id00122">  Edg. I heard myself proclaim'd,<br/>

     And by the happy hollow of a tree<br/>

     Escap'd the hunt. No port is free, no place<br/>

     That guard and most unusual vigilance<br/>

     Does not attend my taking. Whiles I may scape,<br/>

     I will preserve myself; and am bethought<br/>

     To take the basest and most poorest shape<br/>

     That ever penury, in contempt of man,<br/>

     Brought near to beast. My face I'll grime with filth,<br/>

     Blanket my loins, elf all my hair in knots,<br/>

     And with presented nakedness outface<br/>

     The winds and persecutions of the sky.<br/>

     The country gives me proof and precedent<br/>

     Of Bedlam beggars, who, with roaring voices,<br/>

     Strike in their numb'd and mortified bare arms<br/>

     Pins, wooden pricks, nails, sprigs of rosemary;<br/>

     And with this horrible object, from low farms,<br/>

     Poor pelting villages, sheepcotes, and mills,<br/>

     Sometime with lunatic bans, sometime with prayers,<br/>

     Enforce their charity. 'Poor Turlygod! poor Tom!'<br/>

     That's something yet! Edgar I nothing am.             Exit.<br/>

<h2 id="id00123" style="margin-top: 4em">Scene IV.
Before Gloucester's Castle; Kent in the stocks.</h2>

<p id="id00124">Enter Lear, Fool, and Gentleman.</p>

<p id="id00125">  Lear. 'Tis strange that they should so depart from home,<br/>

     And not send back my messenger.<br/>

  Gent. As I learn'd,<br/>

     The night before there was no purpose in them<br/>

     Of this remove.<br/>

  Kent. Hail to thee, noble master!<br/>

  Lear. Ha!<br/>

     Mak'st thou this shame thy pastime?<br/>

  Kent. No, my lord.<br/>

  Fool. Ha, ha! look! he wears cruel garters. Horses are tied by<br/>

the<br/>

     head, dogs and bears by th' neck, monkeys by th' loins, and<br/>

men<br/>

     by th' legs. When a man's over-lusty at legs, then he wears<br/>

     wooden nether-stocks.<br/>

  Lear. What's he that hath so much thy place mistook<br/>

     To set thee here?<br/>

  Kent. It is both he and she-<br/>

     Your son and daughter.<br/>

  Lear. No.<br/>

  Kent. Yes.<br/>

  Lear. No, I say.<br/>

  Kent. I say yea.<br/>

  Lear. No, no, they would not!<br/>

  Kent. Yes, they have.<br/>

  Lear. By Jupiter, I swear no!<br/>

  Kent. By Juno, I swear ay!<br/>

  Lear. They durst not do't;<br/>

     They would not, could not do't. 'Tis worse than murther<br/>

     To do upon respect such violent outrage.<br/>

     Resolve me with all modest haste which way<br/>

     Thou mightst deserve or they impose this usage,<br/>

     Coming from us.<br/>

  Kent. My lord, when at their home<br/>

     I did commend your Highness' letters to them,<br/>

     Ere I was risen from the place that show'd<br/>

     My duty kneeling, came there a reeking post,<br/>

     Stew'd in his haste, half breathless, panting forth<br/>

     From Goneril his mistress salutations;<br/>

     Deliver'd letters, spite of intermission,<br/>

     Which presently they read; on whose contents,<br/>

     They summon'd up their meiny, straight took horse,<br/>

     Commanded me to follow and attend<br/>

     The leisure of their answer, gave me cold looks,<br/>

     And meeting here the other messenger,<br/>

     Whose welcome I perceiv'd had poison'd mine-<br/>

     Being the very fellow which of late<br/>

     Display'd so saucily against your Highness-<br/>

     Having more man than wit about me, drew.<br/>

     He rais'd the house with loud and coward cries.<br/>

     Your son and daughter found this trespass worth<br/>

     The shame which here it suffers.<br/>

  Fool. Winter's not gone yet, if the wild geese fly that way.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00126">          Fathers that wear rags<br/>

            Do make their children blind;<br/>

          But fathers that bear bags<br/>

            Shall see their children kind.<br/>

          Fortune, that arrant whore,<br/>

          Ne'er turns the key to th' poor.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00127">     But for all this, thou shalt have as many dolours for thy<br/>

     daughters as thou canst tell in a year.<br/>

  Lear. O, how this mother swells up toward my heart!<br/>

     Hysterica passio! Down, thou climbing sorrow!<br/>

     Thy element's below! Where is this daughter?<br/>

  Kent. With the Earl, sir, here within.<br/>

  Lear. Follow me not;<br/>

     Stay here.                                            Exit.<br/>

  Gent. Made you no more offence but what you speak of?<br/>

  Kent. None.<br/>

     How chance the King comes with so small a number?<br/>

  Fool. An thou hadst been set i' th' stocks for that question,<br/>

     thou'dst well deserv'd it.<br/>

  Kent. Why, fool?<br/>

  Fool. We'll set thee to school to an ant, to teach thee there's<br/>

no<br/>

     labouring i' th' winter. All that follow their noses are led<br/>

by<br/>

     their eyes but blind men, and there's not a nose among<br/>

twenty<br/>

     but can smell him that's stinking. Let go thy hold when a<br/>

great<br/>

     wheel runs down a hill, lest it break thy neck with<br/>

following<br/>

     it; but the great one that goes upward, let him draw thee<br/>

after.<br/>

     When a wise man gives thee better counsel, give me mine<br/>

again. I<br/>

     would have none but knaves follow it, since a fool gives it.<br/>

          That sir which serves and seeks for gain,<br/>

            And follows but for form,<br/>

          Will pack when it begins to rain<br/>

            And leave thee in the storm.<br/>

          But I will tarry; the fool will stay,<br/>

            And let the wise man fly.<br/>

          The knave turns fool that runs away;<br/>

            The fool no knave, perdy.<br/>

  Kent. Where learn'd you this, fool?<br/>

  Fool. Not i' th' stocks, fool.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00128">                      Enter Lear and Gloucester</p>

<p id="id00129">  Lear. Deny to speak with me? They are sick? they are weary?<br/>

     They have travell'd all the night? Mere fetches-<br/>

     The images of revolt and flying off!<br/>

     Fetch me a better answer.<br/>

  Glou. My dear lord,<br/>

     You know the fiery quality of the Duke,<br/>

     How unremovable and fix'd he is<br/>

     In his own course.<br/>

  Lear. Vengeance! plague! death! confusion!<br/>

     Fiery? What quality? Why, Gloucester, Gloucester,<br/>

     I'ld speak with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife.<br/>

  Glou. Well, my good lord, I have inform'd them so.<br/>

  Lear. Inform'd them? Dost thou understand me, man?<br/>

  Glou. Ay, my good lord.<br/>

  Lear. The King would speak with Cornwall; the dear father<br/>

     Would with his daughter speak, commands her service.<br/>

     Are they inform'd of this? My breath and blood!<br/>

     Fiery? the fiery Duke? Tell the hot Duke that-<br/>

     No, but not yet! May be he is not well.<br/>

     Infirmity doth still neglect all office<br/>

     Whereto our health is bound. We are not ourselves<br/>

     When nature, being oppress'd, commands the mind<br/>

     To suffer with the body. I'll forbear;<br/>

     And am fallen out with my more headier will,<br/>

     To take the indispos'd and sickly fit<br/>

     For the sound man.- Death on my state! Wherefore<br/>

     Should he sit here? This act persuades me<br/>

     That this remotion of the Duke and her<br/>

     Is practice only. Give me my servant forth.<br/>

     Go tell the Duke and 's wife I'ld speak with them-<br/>

     Now, presently. Bid them come forth and hear me,<br/>

     Or at their chamber door I'll beat the drum<br/>

     Till it cry sleep to death.<br/>

  Glou. I would have all well betwixt you.                 Exit.<br/>

  Lear. O me, my heart, my rising heart! But down!<br/>

  Fool. Cry to it, nuncle, as the cockney did to the eels when<br/>

she<br/>

     put 'em i' th' paste alive. She knapp'd 'em o' th' coxcombs<br/>

with<br/>

     a stick and cried 'Down, wantons, down!' 'Twas her brother<br/>

that,<br/>

     in pure kindness to his horse, buttered his hay.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00130">             Enter Cornwall, Regan, Gloucester, Servants.</p>

<p id="id00131">  Lear. Good morrow to you both.<br/>

  Corn. Hail to your Grace!<br/>

                                       Kent here set at liberty.<br/>

  Reg. I am glad to see your Highness.<br/>

  Lear. Regan, I think you are; I know what reason<br/>

     I have to think so. If thou shouldst not be glad,<br/>

     I would divorce me from thy mother's tomb,<br/>

     Sepulchring an adultress. [To Kent] O, are you free?<br/>

     Some other time for that.- Beloved Regan,<br/>

     Thy sister's naught. O Regan, she hath tied<br/>

     Sharp-tooth'd unkindness, like a vulture, here!<br/>

                                   [Lays his hand on his heart.]<br/>

     I can scarce speak to thee. Thou'lt not believe<br/>

     With how deprav'd a quality- O Regan!<br/>

  Reg. I pray you, sir, take patience. I have hope<br/>

     You less know how to value her desert<br/>

     Than she to scant her duty.<br/>

  Lear. Say, how is that?<br/>

  Reg. I cannot think my sister in the least<br/>

     Would fail her obligation. If, sir, perchance<br/>

     She have restrain'd the riots of your followers,<br/>

     'Tis on such ground, and to such wholesome end,<br/>

     As clears her from all blame.<br/>

  Lear. My curses on her!<br/>

  Reg. O, sir, you are old!<br/>

     Nature in you stands on the very verge<br/>

     Of her confine. You should be rul'd, and led<br/>

     By some discretion that discerns your state<br/>

     Better than you yourself. Therefore I pray you<br/>

     That to our sister you do make return;<br/>

     Say you have wrong'd her, sir.<br/>

  Lear. Ask her forgiveness?<br/>

     Do you but mark how this becomes the house:<br/>

     'Dear daughter, I confess that I am old.          [Kneels.]<br/>

     Age is unnecessary. On my knees I beg<br/>

     That you'll vouchsafe me raiment, bed, and food.'<br/>

  Reg. Good sir, no more! These are unsightly tricks.<br/>

     Return you to my sister.<br/>

  Lear. [rises] Never, Regan!<br/>

     She hath abated me of half my train;<br/>

     Look'd black upon me; struck me with her tongue,<br/>

     Most serpent-like, upon the very heart.<br/>

     All the stor'd vengeances of heaven fall<br/>

     On her ingrateful top! Strike her young bones,<br/>

     You taking airs, with lameness!<br/>

  Corn. Fie, sir, fie!<br/>

  Lear. You nimble lightnings, dart your blinding flames<br/>

     Into her scornful eyes! Infect her beauty,<br/>

     You fen-suck'd fogs, drawn by the pow'rful sun,<br/>

     To fall and blast her pride!<br/>

  Reg. O the blest gods! so will you wish on me<br/>

     When the rash mood is on.<br/>

  Lear. No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse.<br/>

     Thy tender-hefted nature shall not give<br/>

     Thee o'er to harshness. Her eyes are fierce; but thine<br/>

     Do comfort, and not burn. 'Tis not in thee<br/>

     To grudge my pleasures, to cut off my train,<br/>

     To bandy hasty words, to scant my sizes,<br/>

     And, in conclusion, to oppose the bolt<br/>

     Against my coming in. Thou better know'st<br/>

     The offices of nature, bond of childhood,<br/>

     Effects of courtesy, dues of gratitude.<br/>

     Thy half o' th' kingdom hast thou not forgot,<br/>

     Wherein I thee endow'd.<br/>

  Reg. Good sir, to th' purpose.<br/>

                                                  Tucket within.<br/>

  Lear. Who put my man i' th' stocks?<br/>

  Corn. What trumpet's that?<br/>

  Reg. I know't- my sister's. This approves her letter,<br/>

     That she would soon be here.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00132">                     Enter [Oswald the] Steward.</p>

<p id="id00133">     Is your lady come?<br/>

  Lear. This is a slave, whose easy-borrowed pride<br/>

     Dwells in the fickle grace of her he follows.<br/>

     Out, varlet, from my sight!<br/>

  Corn. What means your Grace?<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00134">                            Enter Goneril.</p>

<p id="id00135">  Lear. Who stock'd my servant? Regan, I have good hope<br/>

     Thou didst not know on't.- Who comes here? O heavens!<br/>

     If you do love old men, if your sweet sway<br/>

     Allow obedience- if yourselves are old,<br/>

     Make it your cause! Send down, and take my part!<br/>

     [To Goneril] Art not asham'd to look upon this beard?-<br/>

     O Regan, wilt thou take her by the hand?<br/>

  Gon. Why not by th' hand, sir? How have I offended?<br/>

     All's not offence that indiscretion finds<br/>

     And dotage terms so.<br/>

  Lear. O sides, you are too tough!<br/>

     Will you yet hold? How came my man i' th' stocks?<br/>

  Corn. I set him there, sir; but his own disorders<br/>

     Deserv'd much less advancement.<br/>

  Lear. You? Did you?<br/>

  Reg. I pray you, father, being weak, seem so.<br/>

     If, till the expiration of your month,<br/>

     You will return and sojourn with my sister,<br/>

     Dismissing half your train, come then to me.<br/>

     I am now from home, and out of that provision<br/>

     Which shall be needful for your entertainment.<br/>

  Lear. Return to her, and fifty men dismiss'd?<br/>

     No, rather I abjure all roofs, and choose<br/>

     To wage against the enmity o' th' air,<br/>

     To be a comrade with the wolf and owl-<br/>

     Necessity's sharp pinch! Return with her?<br/>

     Why, the hot-blooded France, that dowerless took<br/>

     Our youngest born, I could as well be brought<br/>

     To knee his throne, and, squire-like, pension beg<br/>

     To keep base life afoot. Return with her?<br/>

     Persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter<br/>

     To this detested groom.                 [Points at Oswald.]<br/>

  Gon. At your choice, sir.<br/>

  Lear. I prithee, daughter, do not make me mad.<br/>

     I will not trouble thee, my child; farewell.<br/>

     We'll no more meet, no more see one another.<br/>

     But yet thou art my flesh, my blood, my daughter;<br/>

     Or rather a disease that's in my flesh,<br/>

     Which I must needs call mine. Thou art a boil,<br/>

     A plague sore, an embossed carbuncle<br/>

     In my corrupted blood. But I'll not chide thee.<br/>

     Let shame come when it will, I do not call it.<br/>

     I do not bid the Thunder-bearer shoot<br/>

     Nor tell tales of thee to high-judging Jove.<br/>

     Mend when thou canst; be better at thy leisure;<br/>

     I can be patient, I can stay with Regan,<br/>

     I and my hundred knights.<br/>

  Reg. Not altogether so.<br/>

     I look'd not for you yet, nor am provided<br/>

     For your fit welcome. Give ear, sir, to my sister;<br/>

     For those that mingle reason with your passion<br/>

     Must be content to think you old, and so-<br/>

     But she knows what she does.<br/>

  Lear. Is this well spoken?<br/>

  Reg. I dare avouch it, sir. What, fifty followers?<br/>

     Is it not well? What should you need of more?<br/>

     Yea, or so many, sith that both charge and danger<br/>

     Speak 'gainst so great a number? How in one house<br/>

     Should many people, under two commands,<br/>

     Hold amity? 'Tis hard; almost impossible.<br/>

  Gon. Why might not you, my lord, receive attendance<br/>

     From those that she calls servants, or from mine?<br/>

  Reg. Why not, my lord? If then they chanc'd to slack ye,<br/>

     We could control them. If you will come to me<br/>

     (For now I spy a danger), I entreat you<br/>

     To bring but five-and-twenty. To no more<br/>

     Will I give place or notice.<br/>

  Lear. I gave you all-<br/>

  Reg. And in good time you gave it!<br/>

  Lear. Made you my guardians, my depositaries;<br/>

     But kept a reservation to be followed<br/>

     With such a number. What, must I come to you<br/>

     With five-and-twenty, Regan? Said you so?<br/>

  Reg. And speak't again my lord. No more with me.<br/>

  Lear. Those wicked creatures yet do look well-favour'd<br/>

     When others are more wicked; not being the worst<br/>

     Stands in some rank of praise. [To Goneril] I'll go with<br/>

thee.<br/>

     Thy fifty yet doth double five-and-twenty,<br/>

     And thou art twice her love.<br/>

  Gon. Hear, me, my lord.<br/>

     What need you five-and-twenty, ten, or five,<br/>

     To follow in a house where twice so many<br/>

     Have a command to tend you?<br/>

  Reg. What need one?<br/>

  Lear. O, reason not the need! Our basest beggars<br/>

     Are in the poorest thing superfluous.<br/>

     Allow not nature more than nature needs,<br/>

     Man's life is cheap as beast's. Thou art a lady:<br/>

     If only to go warm were gorgeous,<br/>

     Why, nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear'st<br/>

     Which scarcely keeps thee warm. But, for true need-<br/>

     You heavens, give me that patience, patience I need!<br/>

     You see me here, you gods, a poor old man,<br/>

     As full of grief as age; wretched in both.<br/>

     If it be you that stirs these daughters' hearts<br/>

     Against their father, fool me not so much<br/>

     To bear it tamely; touch me with noble anger,<br/>

     And let not women's weapons, water drops,<br/>

     Stain my man's cheeks! No, you unnatural hags!<br/>

     I will have such revenges on you both<br/>

     That all the world shall- I will do such things-<br/>

     What they are yet, I know not; but they shall be<br/>

     The terrors of the earth! You think I'll weep.<br/>

     No, I'll not weep.<br/>

     I have full cause of weeping, but this heart<br/>

     Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws<br/>

     Or ere I'll weep. O fool, I shall go mad!<br/>

              Exeunt Lear, Gloucester, Kent, and Fool. Storm and<br/>

                                                        tempest.<br/>

  Corn. Let us withdraw; 'twill be a storm.<br/>

  Reg. This house is little; the old man and 's people<br/>

     Cannot be well bestow'd.<br/>

  Gon. 'Tis his own blame; hath put himself from rest<br/>

     And must needs taste his folly.<br/>

  Reg. For his particular, I'll receive him gladly,<br/>

     But not one follower.<br/>

  Gon. So am I purpos'd.<br/>

     Where is my Lord of Gloucester?<br/>

  Corn. Followed the old man forth.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00136">                          Enter Gloucester.</p>

<p id="id00137">     He is return'd.<br/>

  Glou. The King is in high rage.<br/>

  Corn. Whither is he going?<br/>

  Glou. He calls to horse, but will I know not whither.<br/>

  Corn. 'Tis best to give him way; he leads himself.<br/>

  Gon. My lord, entreat him by no means to stay.<br/>

  Glou. Alack, the night comes on, and the bleak winds<br/>

     Do sorely ruffle. For many miles about<br/>

     There's scarce a bush.<br/>

  Reg. O, sir, to wilful men<br/>

     The injuries that they themselves procure<br/>

     Must be their schoolmasters. Shut up your doors.<br/>

     He is attended with a desperate train,<br/>

     And what they may incense him to, being apt<br/>

     To have his ear abus'd, wisdom bids fear.<br/>

  Corn. Shut up your doors, my lord: 'tis a wild night.<br/>

     My Regan counsels well. Come out o' th' storm.<br/>

<p id="id00141">  Kent. Who's there, besides foul weather?<br/>

  Gent. One minded like the weather, most unquietly.<br/>

  Kent. I know you. Where's the King?<br/>

  Gent. Contending with the fretful elements;<br/>

     Bids the wind blow the earth into the sea,<br/>

     Or swell the curled waters 'bove the main,<br/>

     That things might change or cease; tears his white hair,<br/>

     Which the impetuous blasts, with eyeless rage,<br/>

     Catch in their fury and make nothing of;<br/>

     Strives in his little world of man to outscorn<br/>

     The to-and-fro-conflicting wind and rain.<br/>

     This night, wherein the cub-drawn bear would couch,<br/>

     The lion and the belly-pinched wolf<br/>

     Keep their fur dry, unbonneted he runs,<br/>

     And bids what will take all.<br/>

  Kent. But who is with him?<br/>

  Gent. None but the fool, who labours to outjest<br/>

     His heart-struck injuries.<br/>

  Kent. Sir, I do know you,<br/>

     And dare upon the warrant of my note<br/>

     Commend a dear thing to you. There is division<br/>

     (Although as yet the face of it be cover'd<br/>

     With mutual cunning) 'twixt Albany and Cornwall;<br/>

     Who have (as who have not, that their great stars<br/>

     Thron'd and set high?) servants, who seem no less,<br/>

     Which are to France the spies and speculations<br/>

     Intelligent of our state. What hath been seen,<br/>

     Either in snuffs and packings of the Dukes,<br/>

     Or the hard rein which both of them have borne<br/>

     Against the old kind King, or something deeper,<br/>

     Whereof, perchance, these are but furnishings-<br/>

     But, true it is, from France there comes a power<br/>

     Into this scattered kingdom, who already,<br/>

     Wise in our negligence, have secret feet<br/>

     In some of our best ports and are at point<br/>

     To show their open banner. Now to you:<br/>

     If on my credit you dare build so far<br/>

     To make your speed to Dover, you shall find<br/>

     Some that will thank you, making just report<br/>

     Of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow<br/>

     The King hath cause to plain.<br/>

     I am a gentleman of blood and breeding,<br/>

     And from some knowledge and assurance offer<br/>

     This office to you.<br/>

  Gent. I will talk further with you.<br/>

  Kent. No, do not.<br/>

     For confirmation that I am much more<br/>

     Than my out-wall, open this purse and take<br/>

     What it contains. If you shall see Cordelia<br/>

     (As fear not but you shall), show her this ring,<br/>

     And she will tell you who your fellow is<br/>

     That yet you do not know. Fie on this storm!<br/>

     I will go seek the King.<br/>

  Gent. Give me your hand. Have you no more to say?<br/>

  Kent. Few words, but, to effect, more than all yet:<br/>

     That, when we have found the King (in which your pain<br/>

     That way, I'll this), he that first lights on him<br/>

     Holla the other.<br/>

                                             Exeunt [severally].<br/>

<h2 id="id00142" style="margin-top: 4em">Scene II.
Another part of the heath.</h2>

<p id="id00143">Storm still. Enter Lear and Fool.</p>

<p id="id00144">  Lear. Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! rage! blow!<br/>

     You cataracts and hurricanoes, spout<br/>

     Till you have drench'd our steeples, drown'd the cocks!<br/>

     You sulph'rous and thought-executing fires,<br/>

     Vaunt-couriers to oak-cleaving thunderbolts,<br/>

     Singe my white head! And thou, all-shaking thunder,<br/>

     Strike flat the thick rotundity o' th' world,<br/>

     Crack Nature's moulds, all germains spill at once,<br/>

     That makes ingrateful man!<br/>

  Fool. O nuncle, court holy water in a dry house is better than<br/>

this<br/>

     rain water out o' door. Good nuncle, in, and ask thy<br/>

daughters<br/>

     blessing! Here's a night pities nether wise men nor fools.<br/>

  Lear. Rumble thy bellyful! Spit, fire! spout, rain!<br/>

     Nor rain, wind, thunder, fire are my daughters.<br/>

     I tax not you, you elements, with unkindness.<br/>

     I never gave you kingdom, call'd you children,<br/>

     You owe me no subscription. Then let fall<br/>

     Your horrible pleasure. Here I stand your slave,<br/>

     A poor, infirm, weak, and despis'd old man.<br/>

     But yet I call you servile ministers,<br/>

     That will with two pernicious daughters join<br/>

     Your high-engender'd battles 'gainst a head<br/>

     So old and white as this! O! O! 'tis foul!<br/>

  Fool. He that has a house to put 's head in has a good<br/>

head-piece.<br/>

          The codpiece that will house<br/>

            Before the head has any,<br/>

          The head and he shall louse:<br/>

            So beggars marry many.<br/>

          The man that makes his toe<br/>

            What he his heart should make<br/>

          Shall of a corn cry woe,<br/>

            And turn his sleep to wake.<br/>

     For there was never yet fair woman but she made mouths in a<br/>

     glass.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00145">                             Enter Kent.</p>

<p id="id00146">  Lear. No, I will be the pattern of all patience;<br/>

     I will say nothing.<br/>

  Kent. Who's there?<br/>

  Fool. Marry, here's grace and a codpiece; that's a wise man and<br/>

a<br/>

     fool.<br/>

  Kent. Alas, sir, are you here? Things that love night<br/>

     Love not such nights as these. The wrathful skies<br/>

     Gallow the very wanderers of the dark<br/>

     And make them keep their caves. Since I was man,<br/>

     Such sheets of fire, such bursts of horrid thunder,<br/>

     Such groans of roaring wind and rain, I never<br/>

     Remember to have heard. Man's nature cannot carry<br/>

     Th' affliction nor the fear.<br/>

  Lear. Let the great gods,<br/>

     That keep this dreadful pudder o'er our heads,<br/>

     Find out their enemies now. Tremble, thou wretch,<br/>

     That hast within thee undivulged crimes<br/>

     Unwhipp'd of justice. Hide thee, thou bloody hand;<br/>

     Thou perjur'd, and thou simular man of virtue<br/>

     That art incestuous. Caitiff, in pieces shake<br/>

     That under covert and convenient seeming<br/>

     Hast practis'd on man's life. Close pent-up guilts,<br/>

     Rive your concealing continents, and cry<br/>

     These dreadful summoners grace. I am a man<br/>

     More sinn'd against than sinning.<br/>

  Kent. Alack, bareheaded?<br/>

     Gracious my lord, hard by here is a hovel;<br/>

     Some friendship will it lend you 'gainst the tempest.<br/>

     Repose you there, whilst I to this hard house<br/>

     (More harder than the stones whereof 'tis rais'd,<br/>

     Which even but now, demanding after you,<br/>

     Denied me to come in) return, and force<br/>

     Their scanted courtesy.<br/>

  Lear. My wits begin to turn.<br/>

     Come on, my boy. How dost, my boy? Art cold?<br/>

     I am cold myself. Where is this straw, my fellow?<br/>

     The art of our necessities is strange,<br/>

     That can make vile things precious. Come, your hovel.<br/>

     Poor fool and knave, I have one part in my heart<br/>

     That's sorry yet for thee.<br/>

  Fool. [sings]<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00147">          He that has and a little tiny wit-<br/>

            With hey, ho, the wind and the rain-<br/>

          Must make content with his fortunes fit,<br/>

             For the rain it raineth every day.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00148">  Lear. True, my good boy. Come, bring us to this hovel.<br/>

                                         Exeunt [Lear and Kent].<br/>

  Fool. This is a brave night to cool a courtesan. I'll speak a<br/>

     prophecy ere I go:<br/>

          When priests are more in word than matter;<br/>

          When brewers mar their malt with water;<br/>

          When nobles are their tailors' tutors,<br/>

          No heretics burn'd, but wenches' suitors;<br/>

          When every case in law is right,<br/>

          No squire in debt nor no poor knight;<br/>

          When slanders do not live in tongues,<br/>

          Nor cutpurses come not to throngs;<br/>

          When usurers tell their gold i' th' field,<br/>

          And bawds and whores do churches build:<br/>

          Then shall the realm of Albion<br/>

          Come to great confusion.<br/>

          Then comes the time, who lives to see't,<br/>

          That going shall be us'd with feet.<br/>

     This prophecy Merlin shall make, for I live before his time.<br/>

Exit.<br/>
