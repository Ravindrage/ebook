<p id="id00218">  Gent. O, here he is! Lay hand upon him.- Sir,<br/>

     Your most dear daughter-<br/>

  Lear. No rescue? What, a prisoner? I am even<br/>

     The natural fool of fortune. Use me well;<br/>

     You shall have ransom. Let me have a surgeon;<br/>

     I am cut to th' brains.<br/>

  Gent. You shall have anything.<br/>

  Lear. No seconds? All myself?<br/>

     Why, this would make a man a man of salt,<br/>

     To use his eyes for garden waterpots,<br/>

     Ay, and laying autumn's dust.<br/>

  Gent. Good sir-<br/>

  Lear. I will die bravely, like a smug bridegroom. What!<br/>

     I will be jovial. Come, come, I am a king;<br/>

     My masters, know you that?<br/>

  Gent. You are a royal one, and we obey you.<br/>

  Lear. Then there's life in't. Nay, an you get it, you shall get<br/>

it<br/>

     by running. Sa, sa, sa, sa!<br/>

                              Exit running. [Attendants follow.]<br/>

  Gent. A sight most pitiful in the meanest wretch,<br/>

     Past speaking of in a king! Thou hast one daughter<br/>

     Who redeems nature from the general curse<br/>

     Which twain have brought her to.<br/>

  Edg. Hail, gentle sir.<br/>

  Gent. Sir, speed you. What's your will?<br/>

  Edg. Do you hear aught, sir, of a battle toward?<br/>

  Gent. Most sure and vulgar. Every one hears that<br/>

     Which can distinguish sound.<br/>

  Edg. But, by your favour,<br/>

     How near's the other army?<br/>

  Gent. Near and on speedy foot. The main descry<br/>

     Stands on the hourly thought.<br/>

  Edg. I thank you sir. That's all.<br/>

  Gent. Though that the Queen on special cause is here,<br/>

     Her army is mov'd on.<br/>

  Edg. I thank you, sir<br/>

                                               Exit [Gentleman].<br/>

  Glou. You ever-gentle gods, take my breath from me;<br/>

     Let not my worser spirit tempt me again<br/>

     To die before you please!<br/>

  Edg. Well pray you, father.<br/>

  Glou. Now, good sir, what are you?<br/>

  Edg. A most poor man, made tame to fortune's blows,<br/>

     Who, by the art of known and feeling sorrows,<br/>

     Am pregnant to good pity. Give me your hand;<br/>

     I'll lead you to some biding.<br/>

  Glou. Hearty thanks.<br/>

     The bounty and the benison of heaven<br/>

     To boot, and boot!<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00219">                     Enter [Oswald the] Steward.</p>

<p id="id00220">  Osw. A proclaim'd prize! Most happy!<br/>

     That eyeless head of thine was first fram'd flesh<br/>

     To raise my fortunes. Thou old unhappy traitor,<br/>

     Briefly thyself remember. The sword is out<br/>

     That must destroy thee.<br/>

  Glou. Now let thy friendly hand<br/>

     Put strength enough to't.<br/>

                                             [Edgar interposes.]<br/>

  Osw. Wherefore, bold peasant,<br/>

     Dar'st thou support a publish'd traitor? Hence!<br/>

     Lest that th' infection of his fortune take<br/>

     Like hold on thee. Let go his arm.<br/>

  Edg. Chill not let go, zir, without vurther 'cagion.<br/>

  Osw. Let go, slave, or thou diest!<br/>

  Edg. Good gentleman, go your gait, and let poor voke pass. An<br/>

chud<br/>

     ha' bin zwagger'd out of my life, 'twould not ha' bin zo<br/>

long as<br/>

     'tis by a vortnight. Nay, come not near th' old man. Keep<br/>

  Edg. Chill pick your teeth, zir. Come! No matter vor your<br/>

foins.<br/>

                                                 [Oswald falls.]<br/>

  Osw. Slave, thou hast slain me. Villain, take my purse.<br/>

     If ever thou wilt thrive, bury my body,<br/>

     And give the letters which thou find'st about me<br/>

     To Edmund Earl of Gloucester. Seek him out<br/>

     Upon the British party. O, untimely death! Death!<br/>

                                                        He dies.<br/>

  Edg. I know thee well. A serviceable villain,<br/>

     As duteous to the vices of thy mistress<br/>

     As badness would desire.<br/>

  Glou. What, is he dead?<br/>

  Edg. Sit you down, father; rest you.<br/>

     Let's see his pockets; these letters that he speaks of<br/>

     May be my friends. He's dead. I am only sorry<br/>

     He had no other deathsman. Let us see.<br/>

     Leave, gentle wax; and, manners, blame us not.<br/>

     To know our enemies' minds, we'ld rip their hearts;<br/>

     With this ungracious paper strike the sight<br/>

     Of the death-practis'd Duke, For him 'tis well<br/>

     That of thy death and business I can tell.<br/>

  Glou. The King is mad. How stiff is my vile sense,<br/>

     That I stand up, and have ingenious feeling<br/>

     Of my huge sorrows! Better I were distract.<br/>

     So should my thoughts be sever'd from my griefs,<br/>

<h2 id="id00224" style="margin-top: 4em">Scene VII.
A tent in the French camp.</h2>

<p id="id00225">Enter Cordelia, Kent, Doctor, and Gentleman.</p>

<p id="id00226">  Cor. O thou good Kent, how shall I live and work<br/>

     To match thy goodness? My life will be too short<br/>

     And every measure fail me.<br/>

  Kent. To be acknowledg'd, madam, is o'erpaid.<br/>

     All my reports go with the modest truth;<br/>

     Nor more nor clipp'd, but so.<br/>

  Cor. Be better suited.<br/>

     These weeds are memories of those worser hours.<br/>

     I prithee put them off.<br/>

  Kent. Pardon, dear madam.<br/>

     Yet to be known shortens my made intent.<br/>

     My boon I make it that you know me not<br/>

     Till time and I think meet.<br/>

  Cor. Then be't so, my good lord. [To the Doctor] How, does the<br/>

King?<br/>

  Doct. Madam, sleeps still.<br/>

  Cor. O you kind gods,<br/>

     Cure this great breach in his abused nature!<br/>

     Th' untun'd and jarring senses, O, wind up<br/>

     Of this child-changed father!<br/>

  Doct. So please your Majesty<br/>

     That we may wake the King? He hath slept long.<br/>

  Cor. Be govern'd by your knowledge, and proceed<br/>

     I' th' sway of your own will. Is he array'd?<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00227">              Enter Lear in a chair carried by Servants.</p>

<p id="id00228">  Gent. Ay, madam. In the heaviness of sleep<br/>

     We put fresh garments on him.<br/>

  Doct. Be by, good madam, when we do awake him.<br/>

     I doubt not of his temperance.<br/>

  Cor. Very well.<br/>

                                                          Music.<br/>

  Doct. Please you draw near. Louder the music there!<br/>

  Cor. O my dear father, restoration hang<br/>

     Thy medicine on my lips, and let this kiss<br/>

     Repair those violent harms that my two sisters<br/>

     Have in thy reverence made!<br/>

  Kent. Kind and dear princess!<br/>

  Cor. Had you not been their father, these white flakes<br/>

     Had challeng'd pity of them. Was this a face<br/>

     To be oppos'd against the warring winds?<br/>

     To stand against the deep dread-bolted thunder?<br/>

     In the most terrible and nimble stroke<br/>

     Of quick cross lightning? to watch- poor perdu!-<br/>

     With this thin helm? Mine enemy's dog,<br/>

     Though he had bit me, should have stood that night<br/>

     Against my fire; and wast thou fain, poor father,<br/>

     To hovel thee with swine and rogues forlorn,<br/>

     In short and musty straw? Alack, alack!<br/>

     'Tis wonder that thy life and wits at once<br/>

     Had not concluded all.- He wakes. Speak to him.<br/>

  Doct. Madam, do you; 'tis fittest.<br/>

  Cor. How does my royal lord? How fares your Majesty?<br/>

  Lear. You do me wrong to take me out o' th' grave.<br/>

     Thou art a soul in bliss; but I am bound<br/>

     Upon a wheel of fire, that mine own tears<br/>

     Do scald like molten lead.<br/>

  Cor. Sir, do you know me?<br/>

  Lear. You are a spirit, I know. When did you die?<br/>

  Cor. Still, still, far wide!<br/>

  Doct. He's scarce awake. Let him alone awhile.<br/>

  Lear. Where have I been? Where am I? Fair daylight,<br/>

     I am mightily abus'd. I should e'en die with pity,<br/>

     To see another thus. I know not what to say.<br/>

     I will not swear these are my hands. Let's see.<br/>

     I feel this pin prick. Would I were assur'd<br/>

     Of my condition!<br/>

  Cor. O, look upon me, sir,<br/>

     And hold your hands in benediction o'er me.<br/>

     No, sir, you must not kneel.<br/>

  Lear. Pray, do not mock me.<br/>

     I am a very foolish fond old man,<br/>

     Fourscore and upward, not an hour more nor less;<br/>

     And, to deal plainly,<br/>

     I fear I am not in my perfect mind.<br/>

     Methinks I should know you, and know this man;<br/>

     Yet I am doubtful; for I am mainly ignorant<br/>

     What place this is; and all the skill I have<br/>

     Remembers not these garments; nor I know not<br/>

     Where I did lodge last night. Do not laugh at me;<br/>

     For (as I am a man) I think this lady<br/>

     To be my child Cordelia.<br/>

  Cor. And so I am! I am!<br/>

  Lear. Be your tears wet? Yes, faith. I pray weep not.<br/>

     If you have poison for me, I will drink it.<br/>

     I know you do not love me; for your sisters<br/>

     Have, as I do remember, done me wrong.<br/>

     You have some cause, they have not.<br/>

  Cor. No cause, no cause.<br/>

  Lear. Am I in France?<br/>

  Kent. In your own kingdom, sir.<br/>

  Lear. Do not abuse me.<br/>

  Doct. Be comforted, good madam. The great rage<br/>

     You see is kill'd in him; and yet it is danger<br/>

     To make him even o'er the time he has lost.<br/>

     Desire him to go in. Trouble him no more<br/>

     Till further settling.<br/>

  Cor. Will't please your Highness walk?<br/>

  Lear. You must bear with me.<br/>

     Pray you now, forget and forgive. I am old and foolish.<br/>

                              Exeunt. Manent Kent and Gentleman.<br/>

  Gent. Holds it true, sir, that the Duke of Cornwall was so<br/>

slain?<br/>

  Kent. Most certain, sir.<br/>

  Gent. Who is conductor of his people?<br/>

  Kent. As 'tis said, the bastard son of Gloucester.<br/>

  Gent. They say Edgar, his banish'd son, is with the Earl of<br/>

Kent<br/>

     in Germany.<br/>

  Kent. Report is changeable. 'Tis time to look about; the powers<br/>

of<br/>

     the kingdom approach apace.<br/>

  Gent. The arbitrement is like to be bloody.<br/>

     Fare you well, sir.                                 [Exit.]<br/>

  Kent. My point and period will be throughly wrought,<br/>

     Or well or ill, as this day's battle's fought.        Exit.<br/>

<p id="id00232">  Edm. Know of the Duke if his last purpose hold,<br/>

     To change the course. He's full of alteration<br/>

     And self-reproving. Bring his constant pleasure.<br/>

                                              [Exit an Officer.]<br/>

  Reg. Our sister's man is certainly miscarried.<br/>

  Edm. Tis to be doubted, madam.<br/>

  Reg. Now, sweet lord,<br/>

     You know the goodness I intend upon you.<br/>

     Tell me- but truly- but then speak the truth-<br/>

     Do you not love my sister?<br/>

  Edm. In honour'd love.<br/>

  Reg. But have you never found my brother's way<br/>

     To the forfended place?<br/>

  Edm. That thought abuses you.<br/>

  Reg. I am doubtful that you have been conjunct<br/>

     And bosom'd with her, as far as we call hers.<br/>

  Edm. No, by mine honour, madam.<br/>

  Reg. I never shall endure her. Dear my lord,<br/>

     Be not familiar with her.<br/>

  Edm. Fear me not.<br/>

<p id="id00234">  Gon. [aside] I had rather lose the battle than that sister<br/>

     Should loosen him and me.<br/>

  Alb. Our very loving sister, well bemet.<br/>

     Sir, this I hear: the King is come to his daughter,<br/>

     With others whom the rigour of our state<br/>

     Forc'd to cry out. Where I could not be honest,<br/>

     I never yet was valiant. For this business,<br/>

     It toucheth us as France invades our land,<br/>

     Not bolds the King, with others whom, I fear,<br/>

     Most just and heavy causes make oppose.<br/>

  Edm. Sir, you speak nobly.<br/>

  Reg. Why is this reason'd?<br/>

  Gon. Combine together 'gainst the enemy;<br/>

     For these domestic and particular broils<br/>

     Are not the question here.<br/>

  Alb. Let's then determine<br/>

     With th' ancient of war on our proceeding.<br/>

  Edm. I shall attend you presently at your tent.<br/>

  Reg. Sister, you'll go with us?<br/>

  Gon. No.<br/>

  Edg. Before you fight the battle, ope this letter.<br/>

     If you have victory, let the trumpet sound<br/>

     For him that brought it. Wretched though I seem,<br/>

     I can produce a champion that will prove<br/>

     What is avouched there. If you miscarry,<br/>

     Your business of the world hath so an end,<br/>

     And machination ceases. Fortune love you!<br/>

  Alb. Stay till I have read the letter.<br/>

  Edg. I was forbid it.<br/>

     When time shall serve, let but the herald cry,<br/>

     And I'll appear again.<br/>

  Alb. Why, fare thee well. I will o'erlook thy paper.<br/>

     Here is the guess of their true strength and forces<br/>

     Is now urg'd on you.<br/>

  Alb. We will greet the time.                             Exit.<br/>

  Edm. To both these sisters have I sworn my love;<br/>

     Each jealous of the other, as the stung<br/>

     Are of the adder. Which of them shall I take?<br/>

     Both? one? or neither? Neither can be enjoy'd,<br/>

     If both remain alive. To take the widow<br/>

     Exasperates, makes mad her sister Goneril;<br/>

     And hardly shall I carry out my side,<br/>

     Her husband being alive. Now then, we'll use<br/>

     His countenance for the battle, which being done,<br/>

     Let her who would be rid of him devise<br/>

     His speedy taking off. As for the mercy<br/>

     Which he intends to Lear and to Cordelia-<br/>

     The battle done, and they within our power,<br/>

     Shall never see his pardon; for my state<br/>

     Stands on me to defend, not to debate.                Exit.<br/>

     Shall we not see these daughters and these sisters?<br/>

  Lear. No, no, no, no! Come, let's away to prison.<br/>

     We two alone will sing like birds i' th' cage.<br/>

     When thou dost ask me blessing, I'll kneel down<br/>

     And ask of thee forgiveness. So we'll live,<br/>

     As this instructs thee, thou dost make thy way<br/>

     Does not become a sword. Thy great employment<br/>

     Will not bear question. Either say thou'lt do't,<br/>

  Capt. I'll do't, my lord.<br/>

  Edm. About it! and write happy when th' hast done.<br/>

     Mark- I say, instantly; and carry it so<br/>

     As I have set it down.<br/>

     To send the old and miserable King<br/>

     To some retention and appointed guard;<br/>

     Whose age has charms in it, whose title more,<br/>

     To pluck the common bosom on his side<br/>

     Which do command them. With him I sent the Queen,<br/>

     My reason all the same; and they are ready<br/>

     To-morrow, or at further space, t' appear<br/>

     Where you shall hold your session. At this time<br/>

     We sweat and bleed: the friend hath lost his friend;<br/>

     And the best quarrels, in the heat, are curs'd<br/>

     By those that feel their sharpness.<br/>

     The question of Cordelia and her father<br/>

     Requires a fitter place.<br/>

  Alb. Sir, by your patience,<br/>

     I hold you but a subject of this war,<br/>

     Not as a brother.<br/>

  Reg. That's as we list to grace him.<br/>

     Methinks our pleasure might have been demanded<br/>

     Ere you had spoke so far. He led our powers,<br/>

     Bore the commission of my place and person,<br/>

     The which immediacy may well stand up<br/>

     And call itself your brother.<br/>

  Gon. Not so hot!<br/>

     In his own grace he doth exalt himself<br/>

     More than in your addition.<br/>

  Reg. In my rights<br/>

     By me invested, he compeers the best.<br/>

  Gon. That were the most if he should husband you.<br/>

  Reg. Jesters do oft prove prophets.<br/>

  Gon. Holla, holla!<br/>

     That eye that told you so look'd but asquint.<br/>

  Reg. Lady, I am not well; else I should answer<br/>

     From a full-flowing stomach. General,<br/>

     Take thou my soldiers, prisoners, patrimony;<br/>

     Dispose of them, of me; the walls are thine.<br/>

     Witness the world that I create thee here<br/>

     My lord and master.<br/>

  Gon. Mean you to enjoy him?<br/>

  Alb. The let-alone lies not in your good will.<br/>

  Edm. Nor in thine, lord.<br/>

  Alb. Half-blooded fellow, yes.<br/>

  Reg. [to Edmund] Let the drum strike, and prove my title thine.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00250">  Alb. Stay yet; hear reason. Edmund, I arrest thee<br/>

     On capital treason; and, in thine attaint,<br/>

     This gilded serpent [points to Goneril]. For your claim,<br/>

fair<br/>

        sister,<br/>

     I bar it in the interest of my wife.<br/>

     'Tis she is subcontracted to this lord,<br/>

     And I, her husband, contradict your banes.<br/>

     If you will marry, make your loves to me;<br/>

     My lady is bespoke.<br/>

  Gon. An interlude!<br/>

  Alb. Thou art arm'd, Gloucester. Let the trumpet sound.<br/>

     If none appear to prove upon thy person<br/>

     Thy heinous, manifest, and many treasons,<br/>

     There is my pledge [throws down a glove]! I'll prove it on<br/>

thy<br/>

        heart,<br/>

     Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less<br/>

     Than I have here proclaim'd thee.<br/>

  Reg. Sick, O, sick!<br/>

  Gon. [aside] If not, I'll ne'er trust medicine.<br/>

  Edm. There's my exchange [throws down a glove]. What in the<br/>

world<br/>

        he is<br/>

     That names me traitor, villain-like he lies.<br/>

     Call by thy trumpet. He that dares approach,<br/>

     On him, on you, who not? I will maintain<br/>

     My truth and honour firmly.<br/>

  Alb. A herald, ho!<br/>

  Edm. A herald, ho, a herald!<br/>

  Alb. Trust to thy single virtue; for thy soldiers,<br/>

     All levied in my name, have in my name<br/>

     Took their discharge.<br/>

  Reg. My sickness grows upon me.<br/>

  Alb. She is not well. Convey her to my tent.<br/>

                                              [Exit Regan, led.]<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00251">                           Enter a Herald.</p>

<p id="id00252">     Come hither, herald. Let the trumpet sound,<br/>

     And read out this.<br/>

  Capt. Sound, trumpet!                        A trumpet sounds.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00253">  Her. (reads) 'If any man of quality or degree within the lists<br/>

of<br/>

     the army will maintain upon Edmund, supposed Earl of<br/>

Gloucester,<br/>

     that he is a manifold traitor, let him appear by the third<br/>

sound<br/>

     of the trumpet. He is bold in his defence.'<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00254">  Edm. Sound!                                     First trumpet.<br/>

  Her. Again!                                    Second trumpet.<br/>

  Her. Again!                                     Third trumpet.<br/>

                                         Trumpet answers within.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00255">    Enter Edgar, armed, at the third sound, a Trumpet before him.</p>

<p id="id00256">  Alb. Ask him his purposes, why he appears<br/>

     Upon this call o' th' trumpet.<br/>

  Her. What are you?<br/>

     Your name, your quality? and why you answer<br/>

     This present summons?<br/>

  Edg. Know my name is lost;<br/>

     By treason's tooth bare-gnawn and canker-bit.<br/>

     Yet am I noble as the adversary<br/>

     I come to cope.<br/>

  Alb. Which is that adversary?<br/>

  Edg. What's he that speaks for Edmund Earl of Gloucester?<br/>

  Edm. Himself. What say'st thou to him?<br/>

  Edg. Draw thy sword,<br/>

     That, if my speech offend a noble heart,<br/>

     Thy arm may do thee justice. Here is mine.<br/>

     Behold, it is the privilege of mine honours,<br/>

     My oath, and my profession. I protest-<br/>

     Maugre thy strength, youth, place, and eminence,<br/>

     Despite thy victor sword and fire-new fortune,<br/>

     Thy valour and thy heart- thou art a traitor;<br/>

     False to thy gods, thy brother, and thy father;<br/>

     Conspirant 'gainst this high illustrious prince;<br/>

     And from th' extremest upward of thy head<br/>

     To the descent and dust beneath thy foot,<br/>

     A most toad-spotted traitor. Say thou 'no,'<br/>

     This sword, this arm, and my best spirits are bent<br/>

     To prove upon thy heart, whereto I speak,<br/>

     Thou liest.<br/>

  Edm. In wisdom I should ask thy name;<br/>

     But since thy outside looks so fair and warlike,<br/>

     And that thy tongue some say of breeding breathes,<br/>

     What safe and nicely I might well delay<br/>

     By rule of knighthood, I disdain and spurn.<br/>

     Back do I toss those treasons to thy head;<br/>

     With the hell-hated lie o'erwhelm thy heart;<br/>

     Which- for they yet glance by and scarcely bruise-<br/>

     This sword of mine shall give them instant way<br/>

     Where they shall rest for ever. Trumpets, speak!<br/>

                                 Alarums. Fight. [Edmund falls.]<br/>

  Alb. Save him, save him!<br/>

  Gon. This is mere practice, Gloucester.<br/>

     By th' law of arms thou wast not bound to answer<br/>

     An unknown opposite. Thou art not vanquish'd,<br/>

     But cozen'd and beguil'd.<br/>

  Alb. Shut your mouth, dame,<br/>

     Or with this paper shall I stop it. [Shows her her letter to<br/>

     Edmund.]- [To Edmund]. Hold, sir.<br/>

     [To Goneril] Thou worse than any name, read thine own evil.<br/>

     No tearing, lady! I perceive you know it.<br/>

  Gon. Say if I do- the laws are mine, not thine.<br/>

     Who can arraign me for't?<br/>

  Alb. Most monstrous!<br/>

     Know'st thou this paper?<br/>

  Gon. Ask me not what I know.                             Exit.<br/>

  Alb. Go after her. She's desperate; govern her.<br/>

                                              [Exit an Officer.]<br/>

  Edm. What, you have charg'd me with, that have I done,<br/>

     And more, much more. The time will bring it out.<br/>

     'Tis past, and so am I.- But what art thou<br/>

     That hast this fortune on me? If thou'rt noble,<br/>

     I do forgive thee.<br/>

  Edg. Let's exchange charity.<br/>

     I am no less in blood than thou art, Edmund;<br/>

     If more, the more th' hast wrong'd me.<br/>

     My name is Edgar and thy father's son.<br/>

     The gods are just, and of our pleasant vices<br/>

     Make instruments to scourge us.<br/>

     The dark and vicious place where thee he got<br/>

     Cost him his eyes.<br/>

  Edm. Th' hast spoken right; 'tis true.<br/>

     The wheel is come full circle; I am here.<br/>

  Alb. Methought thy very gait did prophesy<br/>

     A royal nobleness. I must embrace thee.<br/>

     Let sorrow split my heart if ever I<br/>

     Did hate thee, or thy father!<br/>

  Edg. Worthy prince, I know't.<br/>

  Alb. Where have you hid yourself?<br/>

     How have you known the miseries of your father?<br/>

  Edg. By nursing them, my lord. List a brief tale;<br/>

     And when 'tis told, O that my heart would burst!<br/>

     The bloody proclamation to escape<br/>

     That follow'd me so near (O, our lives' sweetness!<br/>

     That with the pain of death would hourly die<br/>

     Rather than die at once!) taught me to shift<br/>

     Into a madman's rags, t' assume a semblance<br/>

     That very dogs disdain'd; and in this habit<br/>

     Met I my father with his bleeding rings,<br/>

     Their precious stones new lost; became his guide,<br/>

     Led him, begg'd for him, sav'd him from despair;<br/>

     Never (O fault!) reveal'd myself unto him<br/>

     Until some half hour past, when I was arm'd,<br/>

     Not sure, though hoping of this good success,<br/>

     I ask'd his blessing, and from first to last<br/>

     Told him my pilgrimage. But his flaw'd heart<br/>

     (Alack, too weak the conflict to support!)<br/>

     'Twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief,<br/>

     Burst smilingly.<br/>

  Edm. This speech of yours hath mov'd me,<br/>

     And shall perchance do good; but speak you on;<br/>

     You look as you had something more to say.<br/>

  Alb. If there be more, more woful, hold it in;<br/>

     For I am almost ready to dissolve,<br/>

     Hearing of this.<br/>

  Edg. This would have seem'd a period<br/>

     To such as love not sorrow; but another,<br/>

     To amplify too much, would make much more,<br/>

     And top extremity.<br/>

     Whilst I was big in clamour, came there a man,<br/>

     Who, having seen me in my worst estate,<br/>

     Shunn'd my abhorr'd society; but then, finding<br/>

     Who 'twas that so endur'd, with his strong arms<br/>

     He fastened on my neck, and bellowed out<br/>

     As he'd burst heaven; threw him on my father;<br/>

     Told the most piteous tale of Lear and him<br/>

     That ever ear receiv'd; which in recounting<br/>

     His grief grew puissant, and the strings of life<br/>

     Began to crack. Twice then the trumpets sounded,<br/>

     And there I left him tranc'd.<br/>

  Alb. But who was this?<br/>

  Edg. Kent, sir, the banish'd Kent; who in disguise<br/>

     Followed his enemy king and did him service<br/>

     Improper for a slave.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00257">                Enter a Gentleman with a bloody knife.</p>

<p id="id00258">  Gent. Help, help! O, help!<br/>

  Edg. What kind of help?<br/>

  Alb. Speak, man.<br/>

  Edg. What means that bloody knife?<br/>

  Gent. 'Tis hot, it smokes.<br/>

     It came even from the heart of- O! she's dead!<br/>

  Alb. Who dead? Speak, man.<br/>

  Gent. Your lady, sir, your lady! and her sister<br/>

     By her is poisoned; she hath confess'd it.<br/>

  Edm. I was contracted to them both. All three<br/>

     Now marry in an instant.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00259">                             Enter Kent.</p>

<p id="id00260">  Edg. Here comes Kent.<br/>

  Alb. Produce their bodies, be they alive or dead.<br/>

                                               [Exit Gentleman.]<br/>

     This judgement of the heavens, that makes us tremble<br/>

     Touches us not with pity. O, is this he?<br/>

     The time will not allow the compliment<br/>

     That very manners urges.<br/>

  Kent. I am come<br/>

     To bid my king and master aye good night.<br/>

     Is he not here?<br/>

  Alb. Great thing of us forgot!<br/>

     Speak, Edmund, where's the King? and where's Cordelia?<br/>

                 The bodies of Goneril and Regan are brought in.<br/>

     Seest thou this object, Kent?<br/>

  Kent. Alack, why thus?<br/>

  Edm. Yet Edmund was belov'd.<br/>

     The one the other poisoned for my sake,<br/>

     And after slew herself.<br/>

  Alb. Even so. Cover their faces.<br/>

  Edm. I pant for life. Some good I mean to do,<br/>

     Despite of mine own nature. Quickly send<br/>

     (Be brief in't) to the castle; for my writ<br/>

     Is on the life of Lear and on Cordelia.<br/>

     Nay, send in time.<br/>

  Alb. Run, run, O, run!<br/>

  Edg. To who, my lord? Who has the office? Send<br/>

     Thy token of reprieve.<br/>

  Edm. Well thought on. Take my sword;<br/>

     Give it the Captain.<br/>

  Alb. Haste thee for thy life.                    [Exit Edgar.]<br/>

  Edm. He hath commission from thy wife and me<br/>

     To hang Cordelia in the prison and<br/>

     To lay the blame upon her own despair<br/>

     That she fordid herself.<br/>

  Alb. The gods defend her! Bear him hence awhile.<br/>

                                          [Edmund is borne off.]<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00261">    Enter Lear, with Cordelia [dead] in his arms, [Edgar,<br/>

Captain,<br/>

                        and others following].<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00262">  Lear. Howl, howl, howl, howl! O, you are men of stone.<br/>

     Had I your tongues and eyes, I'ld use them so<br/>

     That heaven's vault should crack. She's gone for ever!<br/>

     I know when one is dead, and when one lives.<br/>

     She's dead as earth. Lend me a looking glass.<br/>

     If that her breath will mist or stain the stone,<br/>

     Why, then she lives.<br/>

  Kent. Is this the promis'd end?<br/>

  Edg. Or image of that horror?<br/>

  Alb. Fall and cease!<br/>

  Lear. This feather stirs; she lives! If it be so,<br/>

     It is a chance which does redeem all sorrows<br/>

     That ever I have felt.<br/>

  Kent. O my good master!<br/>

  Lear. Prithee away!<br/>

  Edg. 'Tis noble Kent, your friend.<br/>

  Lear. A plague upon you, murderers, traitors all!<br/>

     I might have sav'd her; now she's gone for ever!<br/>

     Cordelia, Cordelia! stay a little. Ha!<br/>

     What is't thou say'st, Her voice was ever soft,<br/>

     Gentle, and low- an excellent thing in woman.<br/>

     I kill'd the slave that was a-hanging thee.<br/>

  Capt. 'Tis true, my lords, he did.<br/>

  Lear. Did I not, fellow?<br/>

     I have seen the day, with my good biting falchion<br/>

     I would have made them skip. I am old now,<br/>

     And these same crosses spoil me. Who are you?<br/>

     Mine eyes are not o' th' best. I'll tell you straight.<br/>

  Kent. If fortune brag of two she lov'd and hated,<br/>

     One of them we behold.<br/>

  Lear. This' a dull sight. Are you not Kent?<br/>

  Kent. The same-<br/>

     Your servant Kent. Where is your servant Caius?<br/>

  Lear. He's a good fellow, I can tell you that.<br/>

     He'll strike, and quickly too. He's dead and rotten.<br/>

  Kent. No, my good lord; I am the very man-<br/>

  Lear. I'll see that straight.<br/>

  Kent. That from your first of difference and decay<br/>

     Have followed your sad steps.<br/>

  Lear. You're welcome hither.<br/>

  Kent. Nor no man else! All's cheerless, dark, and deadly.<br/>

     Your eldest daughters have fordone themselves,<br/>

     And desperately are dead.<br/>

  Lear. Ay, so I think.<br/>

  Alb. He knows not what he says; and vain is it<br/>

     That we present us to him.<br/>

  Edg. Very bootless.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00263">                           Enter a Captain.</p>

<p id="id00264">  Capt. Edmund is dead, my lord.<br/>

  Alb. That's but a trifle here.<br/>

     You lords and noble friends, know our intent.<br/>

     What comfort to this great decay may come<br/>

     Shall be applied. For us, we will resign,<br/>

     During the life of this old Majesty,<br/>

     To him our absolute power; [to Edgar and Kent] you to your<br/>

        rights;<br/>

     With boot, and such addition as your honours<br/>

     Have more than merited.- All friends shall taste<br/>

     The wages of their virtue, and all foes<br/>

     The cup of their deservings.- O, see, see!<br/>

  Lear. And my poor fool is hang'd! No, no, no life!<br/>

     Why should a dog, a horse, a rat, have life,<br/>

     And thou no breath at all? Thou'lt come no more,<br/>

     Never, never, never, never, never!<br/>

     Pray you undo this button. Thank you, sir.<br/>

     Do you see this? Look on her! look! her lips!<br/>

     Look there, look there!                            He dies.<br/>

  Edg. He faints! My lord, my lord!<br/>

  Kent. Break, heart; I prithee break!<br/>

  Edg. Look up, my lord.<br/>

  Kent. Vex not his ghost. O, let him pass! He hates him<br/>

     That would upon the rack of this tough world<br/>

     Stretch him out longer.<br/>

  Edg. He is gone indeed.<br/>

  Kent. The wonder is, he hath endur'd so long.<br/>

     He but usurp'd his life.<br/>

  Alb. Bear them from hence. Our present business<br/>

     Is general woe. [To Kent and Edgar] Friends of my soul, you<br/>

        twain<br/>

     Rule in this realm, and the gor'd state sustain.<br/>

  Kent. I have a journey, sir, shortly to go.<br/>

     My master calls me; I must not say no.<br/>

  Alb. The weight of this sad time we must obey,<br/>

     Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say.<br/>

     The oldest have borne most; we that are young<br/>

     Shall never see so much, nor live so long.<br/>

                                       Exeunt with a dead march.<br/>
